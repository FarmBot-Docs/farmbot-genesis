# Shapeways
**[Shapeways](http://shapeways.com)** is the lowest cost consumer 3D printing service available. While they are the lowest cost, don't expect these parts to be cheap from them. To be honest you are better off 3D printing these parts yourself for a fraction of the cost, but in case you don't have a printer or don't have the time to print them yourself, we recommend Shapeways. Select their "Strong and Flexible Plastic" as the material when checking out.

# Alibaba
**[Alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com)** is not your average online store or marketplace. You can't just add stuff to a cart and check out. Instead, you must find a supplier or factory of the parts you need, open up a conversation with them, get quoted, and then make a payment. Then it could be anywhere between 2 and 8 weeks before you receive your parts because they have to make them and ship them across the ocean!

We do not recommend individuals purchase parts through Alibaba, though sometimes it is the only option available. We anticipate having a FarmBot shop soon where you can purchase these few parts from us directly. In the meantime, best of luck!
