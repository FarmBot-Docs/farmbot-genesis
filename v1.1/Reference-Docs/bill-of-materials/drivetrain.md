# V-Wheels
These polycarbonate V-wheels are precision machined to allow FarmBot to move in the X, Y, and Z directions smoothly and precisely. Each wheel requires two bearings and one precision shim to operate correctly.

# Bearings
These stainless steel bearings resist corrosion and have rubber seals to keep debris out. Two of them are used in every V-wheel, and one is used to support the driveshaft in the driveshaft bearing plate.

# M5 Shims
These precision shims are placed in between the two bearings in every V-wheel. They keep the bearings from squishing into each other and binding when the wheel is tightened onto a plate.
