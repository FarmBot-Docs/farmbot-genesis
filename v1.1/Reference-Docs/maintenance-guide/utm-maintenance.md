# Inspect the Seals
It is possible that intense temperature and adverse weather cycles could degrade the rubber seals between the UTM cover and the cables and tubing connected to the UTM.

# Remove Magnetic Debris Buildup
It is possible for dust, soil, and other debris to magnetically attract to the UTM's magnets and build up over time. This debris can prevent the UTM from correctly mounting tools.
