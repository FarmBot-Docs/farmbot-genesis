FarmBot's tracks need to be very straight and parallel with each other in order for the gantry to move smoothly across them. With time, your FarmBot's tracks may move and twist due to a variety of factors such as:
* Screws becoming loose
* Thermal expansion and contraction due to large temperature swings
* Deterioration of supporting infrastructure such as wood posts
* Supporting infrastructure shifting due to soil expansion and contraction
* Falling branches, earthquakes, or other cataclysmic events

Misaligned tracks can cause the system to creak and ultimately bind as the gantry attempts to move across the tracks. This can prevent FarmBot from working and even cause damage to other components. If you notice your tracks have become misaligned, work to fix them as soon as possible.

# Clean Track Surfaces

Once a month, inspect your tracks for an accumulation of mud, dirt, and other debris. Because the tracks are so low to the ground, it is common for them to accumulate unwanted materials. This can cause your gantry unnecessary friction when moving across the tracks, ultimately leading it to bind up if the tracks are not cleaned.

# Realigning Track Plates

Over time your track plates may become misaligned due to shifting supporting infrastructure or a rare impact event such as a tree branch falling onto the tracks. Signs of a misaligned track plate include misaligned track extrusions (see below), twisted track extrusions, difficulty in the gantry moving across extrusion joints, and even visual misalignment.

# Realigning Track Extrusions

It is possible for a track extrusion to loosen and then become misaligned with an adjacent extrusion. Even small misalignments can prevent the gantry from smoothly moving across. Inspect for misalignment by running your fingers across track joints.
