As of v1.1 we have been using Onshape to design and distribute FarmBot Genesis's hardware designs. Onshape is the first fully cloud/browser-based CAD system that is completely free to use for public documents. This means that anyone can access the native FarmBot Genesis 3D CAD models and 2D drawings for free. In addition to viewing, you can also copy and modify the documents to suit your needs, as well as export the individual parts and drawings into other common file formats.
