FarmBot Genesis can be purchased and built in a variety of sizes. The standard sized device is 1.5m wide and 3m in length - its perfect for getting started in a small space. For those who want to grow more food and have the space to accommodate a larger device, we offer several options:
  * The tracks can be lengthened in 1.5m intervals up to a max length of 12m. Extending your tracks is the easiest and lowest cost way to increase your growing area.
  * If you want to expand your capacity even further, you can upgrade to the 3m wide XL gantry. XL devices have a minimum track length of 6m and can also be extended up to 12m in length.

The table below shows the cost/m<sup>2</sup> of growing area based on the size of your FarmBot. Predictably, the larger your FarmBot becomes, the lower the cost is per square meter of growing area. Note that the costs below do not account for [supporting infrastructure](../../FarmBot-Genesis-V1-1/tracks.md), which will also increase in cost as the device size increases.
