FarmBot Genesis kits come with four tools to cover the basics of food production, as well as two tool bays, seed bins, and seed trays. The following documentation pages explain how to assemble and install these tools and more.

Additionally, we have also published the [Tool Spec](../FarmBot-Genesis-V1.1/tools/tool-spec.md) so that you can easily develop your own tools to expand upon the capabilities of your FarmBot.
