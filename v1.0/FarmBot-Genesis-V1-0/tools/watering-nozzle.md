The watering nozzle is a single 3D printed component with a few extra parts for magnetic coupling and electronic verification with the UTM. It works as a simple diffuser nozzle by accepting a concentrated stream of water coming from the UTM and turning it into a gentle shower.

## Step 1: Gather the parts and tools
Gather all the watering nozzle parts from the table below and lay them out in a logical manner. To complete the assembly, you will also need the following tools:
* 2mm hex (allen) driver
* 3mm hex (allen) driver
* 6mm wrench
* 8mm wrench
* Wire strippers

|Qty.                          |Component                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|1                             |Watering Nozzle Base
|2                             |M3 x 16mm Screws
|2                             |M3 Locknuts
|3                             |M5 x 25mm Screws
|3                             |M5 Locknuts
|3                             |M5 Washers
|3                             |15 x 15 x 5mm Ring Magnets
|1                             |18 guage, 5cm length Jumper Wire
|2                             |Zipties
|1                             |Inline Pressure Regulator
|1                             |Garden Hose (not supplied with FarmBot kits)
|1                             |3/4" Female Garden Hose to 1/2" Female NPT Adapter
|1                             |1/2" NPT Solenoid Valve
|1                             |1/2" Female NPT to 1/4" Barbed Adapter
|1                             |Hose Clamp
|2                             |Crimp Terminals

## Step 2: Install the Magnets

{%

title="Opposites attract"
content="For the watering nozzle to correctly mount to the UTM, all magnets on the watering nozzle must be attracted to the magnets in the UTM.

To find the correct orientation for a watering nozzle magnet, hold it near the mounting side of the UTM. Flip it around in your hand until you feel it attracting to the UTM's magnets. This is the correct orientation for mounting to the watering nozzle base."
%}

Secure the three **ring magnets** to the top of the **watering nozzle base** using three **M5 x 25mm** screws and **M5 locknuts**. The screw head should be on the magnet side of the watering nozzle base. Use the **3mm hex driver** and **8mm wrench** to tighten the components.


## Step 3: Install the Electrical Screws
Use the **2mm hex driver** and **6mm wrench** to attach two **M3 x 16mm screws** and **M3 locknuts** into the holes labelled 2 and 3 on the **watering nozzle base**. The screw heads should be on the same side of the base as the magnets.


## Step 4: Add the Jumper Wire
Use **scissors** to cut 25mm worth of **jumper wire**. Then use **wire strippers** to remove 5mm of rubber insulation from both ends of the **jumper wire**.


Attach the **jumper wire** to the bottom of each of the **M3 screws** using the two **zipties**.


## Step 5: Connect FarmBot to the water source
Screw the **inline pressure regulator** onto the **faucet** you will be using to supply FarmBot with municipal water.


Screw the **garden hose** onto the **inline pressure regulator**. *Note that you will need to provide a hose of the appropriate length for your installation - one is not provided with FarmBot kits.*


Screw the **3/4" Female Garden Hose to 1/2" Female NPT Adapter** onto the other end of the **garden hose**.


Screw the **1/2" NPT Solenoid Valve** onto the other end of the **3/4" Female Garden Hose to 1/2" Female NPT Adapter**.


Screw the **1/2" Female NPT to 1/4" Barbed Adapter** onto the **1/2" NPT Solenoid Valve**


Push the **1/4" water tube** onto the **barbed adapter** and secure it with the **hose clamp**.


## Step 6: Wire up the solenoid valve
Strip 1 cm of insulation off of the **2.5m long 2-wire peripheral wire**.


Use pliers to crush a **crimp terminal** onto each of the wires of the **peripheral wire**.


Attach the **crimp terminals** to the **solenoid valve**.




# Change Log

* Now using button head M5 screws.
* Added an inline pressure regulator between the municipal water supply and the hose leading to FarmBot to prevent damaging plants with high flow rates and to prevent leaking between the UTM and the watering nozzle tool.

# Room for Improvement

Nothing to see here!
