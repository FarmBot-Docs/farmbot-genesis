# Step 1: Attach the gantry motor
For this step you will need:
* One NEMA 17 stepper motor and rotary encoder
* One horizontal motor housing
* The gantry motor mount plate
* Four M3 x 16mm screws
* Three M5 x 10mm screws
* Three M5 tee nuts
* The 2mm and 3mm hex drivers

![IMG_6622.jpg](IMG_6622.jpg)

Slide the **motor** into the **motor housing**, ensuring that the shaft of the motor is coming out of the housing and that the motor and encoder's wires are facing down through the open bottom of the housing.

![IMG_6626.jpg](IMG_6626.jpg)

Slide the **gantry motor mount plate** onto the **motor's** shaft and fit it flush against the **motor housing**. The M5 mounting holes of the plate should be facing the same direction as the motor's wiring.

Then use the 2mm hex driver to and four M3 x 16mm screws to attach the motor mount plate and motor housing to the motor.

Slide a **GT2 pulley** onto the **motor** and tighten it using the two M3 setscrews and the 1.5mm hex driver.

![IMG_6646.jpg](IMG_6646.jpg)

Lightly screw three **M5 x 10mm screws** and **M5 tee nuts** onto the **motor mount plate**. The tee nuts should be on the side of the plate opposite the motor.

Slide the **motor assembly** onto the **gantry column** where you plan on mounting your electronics box. The motor shaft should be facing inwards to the bot. Use the 3mm hex driver to tighten the screws.

Slide a 5mm to 5mm flex coupling onto the gantry motor shaft and tighten it using the two M4 setscrews and a 2mm allen wrench.

# Step 2: Attach the driveshaft support bearing
Lightly screw two M5 x 10mm screws and tee nuts onto the driveshaft support bearing bracket.

# Step 3: Install the driveshaft and cable carrier supports
Insert two **M5 x 10mm screws** into a **driveshaft support** and then lightly attach **M5 tee nuts**.

Don't worry about getting the spacing right the first time - you can easily loosen them and make fine adjustments once they are all attached."
%}

Place the assembly into the middle slot on the back side of the **gantry main beam** and use the **3mm driver** to tighten the screw. Repeat the process for all six supports.

# Step 4: Install the short cable carrier mounts
Insert two **M5 x 10mm screws** into a **short cable carrier mount** and lightly screw on two **M5 tee nuts**.

![IMG_20160224_104303.jpg](IMG_20160224_104303.jpg)

Place the assembly into the middle slot on the back side of the **gantry main beam** and tighten the two screws with the **3mm driver**. The mount should be butted up the **gantry corner bracket**.

![IMG_20160224_104328.jpg](IMG_20160224_104328.jpg)

Repeat the process for another short cable carrier mount, and add it to the bottom of the left side **gantry column**.

# Step 5: Insert the driveshaft
Slide five bearings onto the driveshaft.

_Tighten flex coupling onto driveshaft_



![20160902_185431.jpg](20160902_185431.jpg)

_Push in bearing_

_Driveshaft support bearing installed_



![20160902_190047.jpg](20160902_190047.jpg)

_Repeat for all driveshaft supports_

Onto the free end of the driveshaft, slide a GT2 pulley, then a 5mm x 16mm x 5mm bearing, and then a 5mm lock collar. Position the bearing inside the driveshaft bearing plate.

![20160902_185050.jpg](20160902_185050.jpg)

_Add pulley, bearing plate, and lock collar_



![20160902_185731.jpg](20160902_185731.jpg)

_Tighten bearing plate_
