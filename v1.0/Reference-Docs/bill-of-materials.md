content="If you're thinking about building a FarmBot yourself, be aware that the prices in the tables above and below do not take into account shipping fees, taxes, minimum order quantities, and waste. If you build one FarmBot on your own, expect to pay 20-25% more for the components than these tables indicate.

Also note that the grand total does not include materials for supporting infrastructure such as a raised bed. The type of infrastructure you decide to install could cost as little as $10 for small wood posts in the ground or as much as $300 for a high quality raised bed with soil.

**Overall, expect to pay between $2,700 and $3,000 to build a single FarmBot on your own.**"
