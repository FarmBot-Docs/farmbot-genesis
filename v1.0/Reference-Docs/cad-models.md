## 3D CAD Models
You can download CAD models for every component and assembly in various formats in **[this folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-wExYzQcnp3UlhaYTllM1JUVjA&usp=sharing)**

## 2D Drawings
We currently have a very limited number of 2D drawings available for FarmBot Genesis components. They can be be found on the [Bill of Materials](bill-of-materials.md) page along with the reference component. We anticipate having a complete set of drawings to accompany the v1.1 hardware design.

## Manufacturing Files
**[This folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-wExYzQcnp3RUh5YUNEYmVRZUE&usp=sharing)** contains the .DXF files needed to manufacture the plates as well as the .STL files for 3D printing the plastic components.
