# Step 1: Attach the RAMPS Shield to the Power Supply
Use **2-16 stranded wire** (two stranded wires of 16 gauge) to connect the **power supply** to the **RAMPS shield**. One wire should connect the ground output of the power supply to the negative/ground input on the RAMPS shield. The other wire should connect the +12V output of the power supply to the positive input on the RAMPS shield.
