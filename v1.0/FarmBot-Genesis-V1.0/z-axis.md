# Change Log

  * Increased the size of the slot on the z-axis motor mount for the motor and encoder wires to be passed through more easily.
  * Added a second slot on the z-axis motor mount for the motor and encoder wires to be passed to through the front of the mount to the front of the z-axis extrusion.
  * Added an extra flange to the z-axis motor mount to increase strength in its connection to the z-axis extrusion.
  * Completely re-designed the z-axis motor cover to accomodate larger motors/encoders and their wires, and added a mounting flange to maintain a secure connection to the z-axis extrusion.
  * Switch to button head M5 screws.
  * Introduced four plastic z-axis drag chain guides to help keep the drag chain in place and also offer a place for the motor and encoder wires to securely run down the z-axis en-route to the z-axis drag chain.
  * Increased the size of the z-axis drag chain from 15 x 30mm to 15 x 40mm to accommodate the motor and encoder wires.

# Room for Improvement

* Explore a bent metal plate versions of the z-axis motor mount and the z-axis cable carrier guides
 * The drag chain mounting plate's mounting holes could be a slot to allow or more flexibility
