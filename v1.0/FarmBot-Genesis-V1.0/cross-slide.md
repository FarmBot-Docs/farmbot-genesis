# Change Log

* Horizontal motor housing has been completely re-designed to better protect the ends of the motor and the rotary encoder from rain.
* Flipped the orientation of the long drag chain mount and added a gusset for support.
* Increased the size of the slot on the cross-slide for the motor and encoder wires to be passed through more easily.
* Increased the tolerance of the eccentric spacer holes on the cross-slide plate.
* Switched to button head M5 screws.
* Increased the cross-slide plate width by 10mm to accommodate the larger z-axis cable carrier and adjusted the mounting holes accordingly.
* Added a V-wheel with eccentric spacer to the middle of the bottom edge of the cross-slide plate for added strength in the connection with the gantry main beam.

# Room for Improvement

* The Z axis cable carrier mounting holes could be changed to a slot to allow for more flexibility with which cable carrier to use, and where exactly it is mounted on the plate
 * Explore a bent metal plate version of the long drag chain mount
