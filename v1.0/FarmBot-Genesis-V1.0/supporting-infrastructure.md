FarmBot's tracks need to be attached to supporting infrastructure. Where you decide to install your FarmBot will determine how you setup your tracks and therefore what type of supporting infrastructure you need. You might attach your track plates to 2x4 wood posts, aluminum extrusion posts, or to existing infrastructure such as a raised bed or greenhouse walls. The choice is up to you how you set this up.

content="If you recently ordered a FarmBot kit, you may want to begin building your supporting infrastructure while your FarmBot is in the mail. This way you'll be prepared for a faster assembly time when your package arrives."

We've prepared documentation for two common installation methods:
  * [Building a Raised Bed](../FarmBot-Genesis-V1.0/supporting-infrastructure/building-a-raised-bed.md)
  * [Setting up Wooden Posts Only](../FarmBot-Genesis-V1.0/supporting-infrastructure/setting-up-wooden-posts-only.md)

In the future we'll add more documentation for greenhouse installs, aluminum extrusion post installs, and more.
