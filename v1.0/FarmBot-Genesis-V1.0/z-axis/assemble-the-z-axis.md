|12                            |M5 Tee Nuts
|1                             |Z-Axis Motor Bracket
|1                             |Vertical Motor Housing
|4                             |Z-Axis Cable Carrier Guides
|1                             |NEMA 17 Stepper Motor and Rotary Encoder with 3500mm length cables
|1                             |5mm to 8mm Flex Coupling
|1                             |8 x 1000mm Leadscrew

# Step 2: Attach the Stepper Motor to the Z-Axis motor bracket
Feed the **z-axis motor/encoder cables** through the **z-axis motor mount**.

![IMG_6658.jpg](_images/IMG_6658.jpg)

Attach the **z-axis stepper motor** to the **z-axis motor mount** using four **M3 x 10mm screws**.

![IMG_6659.jpg](_images/IMG_6659.jpg)

# Step 3: Attach the motor to the z-axis extrusion
Partially screw two **M5 x 10mm screws** and **M5 tee nuts** into the **z-axis motor bracket**.

# Step 4: Attach the Leadscrew
Tighten the 8mm side of the **5 to 8mm flex coupling** onto the **leadscrew**.

Tighten the 5mm side of the **5 to 8mm flex coupling** onto the shaft of the **z-axis motor**.
