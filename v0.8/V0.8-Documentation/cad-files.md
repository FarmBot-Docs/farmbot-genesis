All of the plates can be CNC routed, laser cut, or waterjet cut. The motor housings, Universal Tool Mount, cable carrier brackets, and Tools can be 3D printed. 3D CAD files and .STL and .DXF files for manufacturing can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/a/roryaronson.com/folderview?id=0B-wExYzQcnp3fjAtY242WVJ2SUE3WURsWUlCNmxSNTl2ajVicTg5WVpfTm5jeXZxbi1VVHM&usp=drive_web&tid=0B-wExYzQcnp3bmY4STBfSmJMQWc).

FarmBot Genesis V0.8 was designed natively in SolidWorks 2014. Using SolidWorks 2014 or a newer version will provide the most seamless experience if you are interested in viewing or modifying the 3D part files. You can download ll files [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-wExYzQcnp3fjAtY242WVJ2SUE3WURsWUlCNmxSNTl2ajVicTg5WVpfTm5jeXZxbi1VVHM). For those without access to SolidWorks, we have converted the files to other commonly used file formats.
