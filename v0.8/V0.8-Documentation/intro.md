Genesis V0.8 is nearly a production ready device. In this version, we sourced all corrosion resistant components (bearings, screws, etc) to make FarmBot a truly long lasting product built for harsh environments. We made small modifications to some of the 3D printed brackets so that they resist deforming, and notable changes to the Universal Tool Mount to improve reliability. The plates have been upgraded to 5mm thick, and screws lengthened to support this. This time around, we made two prototypes: a 'standard' size FarmBot that is 3m long and 1.5m wide, and an 'XL' size that is 6m long and 3m wide for four times the growing area. These two form factors will become the standardized machine sizes that we launch on Kickstarter with.

# Change Log

  * All plates have been upgraded to be 5mm thick, and screws have been lengthened appropriately
  * The UTM has been enlarged to accept a new layout of 12 electrical connections, 3 liquid/gas lines, and 3 magnets
  * Change the UTM electrical connection to use flag terminals instead of standard ring terminals
  * The UTM now has a 3D printable rain cover featuring 4 rubber grommets that allow the electrical and liquid/gas lines to pass through
  * Sourced stainless steel rubber sealed ball bearings for all the V-wheels
  * Added stainless steel washers between plates and locknuts to prevent damaging the plates and improve holding strength
  * Sourced stainless steel setscrews, M3 screws, and other miscellaneous components
  * Added a gusset to the 3D printed cable carrier brackets so that they resist deforming, especially due to night/day heat cycles
  * Changed the custom electronics box to an off-the-shelf enclosure and a laser cut acrylic electronics mounting plate
  * Sourced an enclosure for the power supply
