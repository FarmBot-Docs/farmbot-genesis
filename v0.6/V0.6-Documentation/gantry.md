## Gantry Assembly Instructions
**Assemble the Gantry Plates**
  * Gather and lay out all of the parts. You will need: 2 Gantry Plates, 8 solid V-wheel kits, and 2 eccentric spacers. It is best to lay out the gantry plates as a mirror image of each other and attach all of the wheel kits facing towards you to ensure you end up with both a left facing and a right facing assembly!
  * Attach the three solid V-wheel assemblies with normal spacers onto each plate. The order of parts is: Screw head, Plate, Spacer, Wheel Assembly, Lock-nut. Use a 3mm allen wrench and a 8mm crescent wrench to tighten the assemblies. Use a moderate amount of torque.
  * Attach the single solid V-wheel assembly with the eccentric spacer onto each plate. The eccentric spacer fits into the largest hole on the plate. You should now have two Gantry plates with 4 V-wheel assemblies on each.
  * Attach the Gantry Plate Assemblies to the Gantry Columns using 4 8mm M5 screws and tee nuts for each assembly. Make sure that the column is attached to the same side of the Gantry Plate as the V-wheel assemblies. It is easiest to partially screw together all of the screws and tee nuts, slide in the extrusion, and then tighten all of the screws at once.

**Assemble the Gantry Main Beam**
  * Attach the two corner brackets at either end using 2 8mm M5 screws and tee nuts for each bracket. Make sure both of the brackets are in the same orientation and on the same side of the extrusion.
  * Lightly screw together 5 sets of 25mm M5 screws and tee nuts and slide them onto the Gantry Main Beam. Evenly distribute them across the beam and then tighten them into place.

**Attach the Column Assemblies to the Main Beam Assembly**
  * Using two 8mm M5 screws on each side. Make sure that the V-wheels are facing outward and both of the plates are attached to same side of the Main Beam, and facing in the same direction.

**Attach Gantry to Tracks**
  * Feed and Secure Belts
