FarmBot Genesis V0.1 was the first FarmBot ever built. The physical manifestation of it closely resembles the original FarmBot design from the FarmBot Whitepaper. The goal of V0.1 was to build something as quick as possible both to show prospective contributors that the project was “real” and to learn what was good and bad about the initial design.

Though V0.1 never saw anymore development past the initial track and gantry scaffolding and some playing around with the motors and electronics, it served as a quick way to learn and it continues to provide insight into the hardware design as it sits in Rory’s backyard subject to the elements and different modes of failure.

V0.1 was developed from June 2013 to April 2014 by Rory Aronson. V0.1 is not being actively developed as the Genesis model has moved onto new versions.
