FarmBot Genesis V0.1 was designed natively in SolidWorks 2013. Using SolidWorks 2013 or a newer version will provide the most seamless experience if you are interested in viewing or modifying the 3D part files. For those without access to SolidWorks, we have converted the files to other commonly used file formats.

Files can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/a/roryaronson.com/folderview?id=0B-wExYzQcnp3a0hibzJScWxZLXc&usp=drive_web&tid=0B-wExYzQcnp3bmY4STBfSmJMQWc).
