The replacement quick connect terminals are located in a small plastic bag.

# Step 1: Cut off the incorrect terminals

Use scissors to cut off the two incorrect terminals. Cut off as little wire as possible.

# Step 2: Remove the heatshrink

Using your fingernails, carefully remove the **black heatshrink** from the cable. Also, slide the white heatshrink labelled `H20` away from the end of the cable by about 50mm.

# Step 3: Carefully cut off the outer cable insulation

Using scissors or wire strippers, *carefully* remove 25mm (1 inch) of the **black outer cable insulation** from the cable without cutting through or damaging the red or black inner wire insulation.

content="If using scissors, a good technique is to lightly grip the cable with the scissors and then rotate the cable in the scissors to *slowly* slice through the insulation. Then put the scissors down and use your fingernails to rip through the rest of the insulation and remove it."

# Step 5: Carefully cut off the inner wire insulation

Using scissors or wire strippers, *carefully* remove about 5mm (1/4 inch) of the **red and black inner wire insulation**. Take your time!

# Step 6: Crimp on the new terminals

Insert one of the wires all the way into the round half of one of the new **quick connect terminals**. Then use needle nose pliers to crimp the round portion of the terminal. You will need to use significant force to perform the crimping action. Once crimped, the wire should be securely attached to the terminal.
