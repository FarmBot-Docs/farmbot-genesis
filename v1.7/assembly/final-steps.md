# Software setup

You're now ready to move onto the software portion of setting up your FarmBot. Refer to the [getting started guide](https://software.farm.bot/docs/getting-started) on our software documentation hub for instructions on how to:

- Create a web app account
- Configure FarmBot to connect to your WiFi network and web app account
- Complete the setup wizard
- Use the FarmBot web app

# Picking seeds

Now that you've got your bot assembled and connected to the web, it's time to start growing things! Most common garden veggies will work great with FarmBot, though there are some limitations and best practices. Check out our [seed selection guide](http://seeds.farm.bot) for tips and best practices.

# Storing extra parts

Your FarmBot kit included a few extra pieces of some small parts such as screws and nuts just in case we miscounted by a few or you lost anything in the grass during assembly.

We recommend keeping everything that is left over in a box along with the getting started guide, camera calibration card, the microSD card adapter, and all of the assembly tools.

_For illustrative purposes only. Not all kits will have these exact parts left over after assembly._

# Trimming belts

About a week after using your FarmBot, you may consider using scissors to trim off excess belt. This can make for a tidier installation, especially if you didn't build your FarmBot to the maximum possible size.

Just keep in mind that once cut, there is no gluing the belt back together - you would need to [order new belts](https://farm.bot/search?q=Belt) if you made a mistake. Only trim if you are certain you won't need the extra length!
