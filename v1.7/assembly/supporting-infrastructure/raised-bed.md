Building a **fixed raised bed** is the recommended method for installing FarmBot Genesis or Genesis (XL) outdoors. In these instructions we show you how to build a simple but sturdy bed that will fit into most yards, look great, and last a lifetime.

# Maximum raised bed size

The reference designs shown on this documentation page are for a **maximally sized** fixed raised bed for the stock Genesis and Genesis (XL) kits. If you are designing a bed for a smaller installation, you will need to modify the dimensions of the lumber and post hole layouts.

We recommend building your raised bed as large as possible to get the most value out of your FarmBot, while making sure you do not exceed the [maximum size limit](../supporting-infrastructure.md#maximum-size).

# Step 1: Acquire materials

# Step 2: Dig post holes

Dig **post holes** according to the diagrams below. A post hole digger and pick axe can help with tougher soils.

# Step 3: Prepare the materials

Cut all of your lumber to the lengths shown in the table in [step 1](#step-1-acquire-materials). Sand all of the wood surfaces to remove any markings and splinters. If desired, stain the wood or apply a protective coating of your choice.

# Step 4: Postion the posts

Place all of the **posts** in the holes. The top of the posts should be positioned 300mm above the ground.

Importantly, all of the post tops must be level with each other. Dig out or back fill each hole as necessary to ensure the tops of all posts are level and the correct height off the ground.

" %}

# Step 5: Attach the short walls

Clamp a **short wall** to the **posts** on one of the short sides of the bed. The posts should be flush with the top edge and ends of the short wall. If you are building an (XL) bed, also clamp the middle post to the short wall.

Drill appropriately sized holes for the lag screws or bolts you will be using. There should be two holes per post. The upper holes should be positioned 50mm from the top edge of the short wall. The lower holes should be positioned 50mm from the bottom edge of the short wall. All holes should be center-aligned on the post.

{% include gallery.html images="
![drill short wall genesis](_images/fixed_raised_bed_drill_short_wall.png)
![drill short wall genesis xl](_images/fixed_raised_bed_drill_short_wall_xl.png)
" %}

Attach the **short wall** to the **posts** using **M10 x 100mm lag screws** and **M10 washers** or equivalent. Once the wall is fastened to all of the posts, you may remove the clamps.

{% include gallery.html images="
![attach short wall genesis](_images/fixed_raised_bed_attach_short_wall.png)
![attach short wall genesis xl](_images/fixed_raised_bed_attach_short_wall_xl.png)
" %}

Repeat for the second **short wall** on the opposite side of the bed.

![second short wall genesis](_images/fixed_raised_bed_attach_second_short_wall.png)
![second short wall genesis xl](_images/fixed_raised_bed_attach_second_short_wall_xl.png)
" %}

# Step 6: Attach the long walls

Clamp the **long wall(s)** to the posts along a long side of the bed. The ends of the long wall(s) should be flush with the outer face of the short walls. If you are building an (XL) bed, the two long walls must meet at the middle of the middle post.

Drill two holes per wall-post attachment point. The upper holes should be positioned 80mm from the top edge of the long wall(s). The lower holes should be positioned 80mm from the bottom edge of the long wall(s).

All holes should be center-aligned on the post except for where the two long walls meet: these holes should be positioned 17.5mm from the ends of the long walls to best share the common post.

{% include gallery.html images="
![position the long walls for genesis](_images/fixed_raised_bed_position_long_walls.png)
![position the long walls for genesis xl](_images/fixed_raised_bed_position_long_walls_xl.png)
![position the long wall flush](_images/fixed_raised_bed_position_long_wall.png)
![position the long walls for genesis xl](_images/fixed_raised_bed_position_long_walls_xl_2.png)
" %}

Attach the **long wall(s)** to the **posts** using **M10 x 100mm lag screws** and **M10 washers** or equivalent. Once fastened to all of the posts, you may remove the clamps.

{% include gallery.html images="
![attach long wall for genesis](_images/fixed_raised_bed_attach_long_wall.png)
![attach long walls for genesis xl](_images/fixed_raised_bed_attach_long_wall_xl.png)
" %}

Repeat for the remaining **long wall(s)** on the opposite side of the bed.

![remaining long walls for genesis xl](_images/fixed_raised_bed_remaining_long_wall_xl.png)
" %}

# Step 7: Install tensioning cables (optional)

With larger raised beds, especially those for FarmBot Genesis XL, it is possible that expansion and contraction of the soil will cause the longer sides of the raised bed to bend outwards, causing track misalignment. If you think that your bed will not be sturdy enough to resist bending, consider adding stainless steel tensioning cables every 3m to prevent the long sides of the bed from being pushed away from each other. The cables should be positioned in the lower half of the bed so as to not interfere with the FarmBot's tools once buried in the soil.

" %}

# Step 8: Fill the bed

Back-fill the post holes with native soil, making sure to compact around the posts to reduce movement. Then fill the bed with gardening soil or a mix of native soil and compost, keeping out large rocks and branches. The Genesis bed will require approximately 1m<sup>2</sup> of soil, while the Genesis (XL) bed will require approximately 4m<sup>2</sup>.
