Building a **mobile raised bed** is the recommended method for installing FarmBot Genesis **indoors**. In these instructions we show you how to build a simple but sturdy bed that can be easily moved around a classroom, lab, warehouse, or museum space.

# Determining bed size

We recommend building your mobile raised bed as large as possible to get the most value out of your FarmBot, while making sure you do not exceed the [maximum size limit](../supporting-infrastructure.md#maximum-size). This will ensure you get the most value out of your FarmBot without making the bed unnecessarily large, which can be more difficult to move around and add cost.

{%

title="Consider your space"
content="In determining how large your bed can be, consider if you will ever need to move the bed from room to room, down any hallways, around any corners, and/or through any doorways. Your bed should be able to fit nicely in all the places you want to place it *and* be moveable between those places."

The reference design shown on this documentation page is for a **maximally sized** mobile raised bed for the stock Genesis kit. The outer dimensions of the bed (where the tracks will be mounted) will be 1.36m wide by 3m in length, with the cable carrier support adding an additional 0.04m to the total width. The height from the floor to the top of the bed will be approximately 0.7m.

If you are designing a bed for a smaller installation, you will need to modify the dimensions of the lumber as needed.

# Step 2: Lay out the floor panels and legs

Lay the two **side floor panels** on the floor to form the outer shape of the bed. There should be about a 0.5m gap between them. The 1280mm edges should be on the short sides of the bed outline.

![floor panels](_images/mobile_raised_bed_floor_panels.png)

# Step 3: Mark where the legs will go

Stand the four **legs** up on the four corners of the **floor panels**. Using a pencil, mark where the inner edges of the legs meet the floor panels. Then remove the legs.

![floor panels with legs](_images/mobile_raised_bed_floor_panels_with_legs.png)

# Step 4: Cut and attach the floor supports

If not already cut to length, cut the **floor supports** such that they will fit on the **floor panels** as shown, ensuring that they do not intrude on the space needed for the legs as marked in the previous step.

![floor panel supports](_images/mobile_raised_bed_floor_panel_supports.png)

Flip everything over and attach the supports to the panels using **50mm screws** spaced roughly every 150mm.

![floor panel support screws](_images/mobile_raised_bed_floor_panel_support_screws.png)

# Step 5: Attach the short walls

Temporarily raise one **floor panel** subassembly off of the floor by 90mm by positioning **legs** underneath the **floor supports**.

![raised floor panel subassembly](_images/mobile_raised_bed_raised_floor_panel_subassembly.png)

Attach a **short wall** to the **short floor support** using **75mm screws** spaced roughly every 150mm. Ensure you offset the screws from those used in the previous step to ensure there are no collisions. You may want to pre-drill through the short wall.

![short wall and floor panel](_images/mobile_raised_bed_short_wall_and_floor_panel.png)

Repeat for the second panel and second short wall.

![both floor panels and short walls](_images/mobile_raised_bed_both_floor_panels_and_short_walls.png)

# Step 6: Attach the long walls

Position one of the **long walls** such that its end faces are flush with the outer faces of the **short walls**. Then attach it to the **long floor supports** using **75mm screws** spaced roughly every 150mm. Ensure you offset the screws from those used in the previous steps to ensure there are no collisions. You may want to pre-drill through the long wall.

![first long wall attached](_images/mobile_raised_bed_first_long_wall_attached.png)

Repeat for the second long wall.

![both long walls attached](_images/mobile_raised_bed_both_long_walls_attached.png)

# Step 7: Attach the legs

Using the help of another person (or two), carefully flip the raised bed upside down.

{%

title="Don't trip!"
content="Remember: the **legs** are underneath the bed because you temporarily used them to offset the panels from the floor. Make sure not to trip on them when flipping the bed."
%}

![upside down](_images/mobile_raised_bed_upside_down.png)

Position one of the **legs** in the corner of the bed.

![first leg](_images/mobile_raised_bed_first_leg.png)

Mark and pre-drill one hole for an **M10 bolt** all the way through the long wall and leg. Then mark and pre-drill a second hole all the way through the short wall and leg. You may want to clamp the leg in place for pre-drilling.

{%

type="warning"
title="Don't let the bolts hit each other"
content="Make sure to stagger the holes slightly so that the bolt coming in from one side of the bed does not hit the bolt coming in from the other side."
%}

![leg bolt holes](_images/mobile_raised_bed_leg_bolt_holes.png)

Attach the **leg** to the bed using two **M10 x 150mm bolts**, four **large M10 washers**, and two **M10 nuts**. One washer should be placed between each bolt head and the wood and between each nut and the wood.

![leg attached with bolts](_images/mobile_raised_bed_leg_attached_with_bolts.png)

Repeat for the remaining three **legs**.

![all legs attached](_images/mobile_raised_bed_all_legs_attached.png)

# Step 8: Attach the casters

Using four **75mm screws**, attach a **caster** to the bottom of a **leg**.

![Caster](_images/mobile_raised_bed_caster.png)

Repeat for the remaining three casters.

![Casters](_images/mobile_raised_bed_casters.png)

# Step 9: Attach the middle floor panel

With the help of an extra person, flip the raised bed over onto its wheels. You may want to lock the casters before flipping the bed over, to prevent it from rolling.

![On Wheels](_images/mobile_raised_bed_on_wheels.png)

Position the **middle floor panel** over the gap in the middle of the bed, and attach it to the **side floor panels** using **30mm screws** spaced roughly every 150mm.

![middle panel attached](_images/mobile_raised_bed_middle_panel_attached.png)

# Step 10: Attach the cable carrier supports

Attach the upper **cable carrier support** to the **long wall** using **T25 x 75mm wood screws** or equivalent. The cable carrier support should be positioned on the long wall where you plan to have your FarmBot's electronics box (the left long wall when looking at the front of the FarmBot). The top of the support should be positioned 60mm from the top of the bed.

![install cable carrier support](_images/mobile_raised_bed_install_cable_carrier_support.png)

Attach the lower **cable carrier support** to the **long wall** using **T25 x 75mm wood screws** or equivalent. The top surface should be positioned 20mm or more below the bottom surface of the first support.

![install second cable carrier support](_images/mobile_raised_bed_install_second_cable_carrier_support.png)

# Step 11: Apply the sealer or stain

Consider using an orbital sander to smooth out any rough edges and corners, and remove any markings on the wood. Then follow the instructions on the the can of the **stain or sealer** you purchased to give your bed a finished look. While this step is optional, it can go a long way towards improving the aesthetics of your FarmBot installation.

# Step 12: Add the bed liner

Unfold the **tarp** and lay it in the bed such that it wraps up the side walls. You can cut off the extra tarp material or simply fold it back into the bed. Some cuts may need to be made to facilitate tidy folding. Optionally, you may use a staple gun to secure the tarp in place, though the soil will also hold it in place just fine.

# Step 13: Fill the bed

Fill the bed with a mix of soil and compost, and keep out large rocks and branches. We recommend purchasing potting soil from your local nursery.
