When you first open up your FarmBot kit, pull out all of the pre-assemblies, individual components, and part bags so that you develop a full idea of what's included. Place everything on a table or worksurface that will prevent the loss of any small parts. Ensure there are no parts remaining in the packaging before recycling.
