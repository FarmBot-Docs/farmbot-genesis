## Step 2: Attach the Delrin Leadscrew Block
Use two **M5x16mm screws** and two **M5 locknuts** to attach the **delrin leadscrew block** to the **cross-slide plate**.

![IMG_0226.JPG](_images/IMG_0226.JPG)

## Step 3: Attach the Stepper Motor
Use four **M3x10mm screws** to attach the **stepper motor** and **motor housing** to the **cross-slide plate**. Make sure the motor and housing are on the same side of the cross-slide plate as the delrin leadscrew block, and that the motor's wiring and the motor housing's open side are facing down towards the delrin leadscrew block.

![IMG_0230.JPG](_images/IMG_0230.JPG)



![IMG_0231.JPG](_images/IMG_0231.JPG)

Slide a **GT2 pulley** onto the **stepper motor** shaft.

![IMG_0235.JPG](_images/IMG_0235.JPG)

Make sure that one of the setscrews is lined up with the flat spot of the shaft and then tighten the setscrews with the **2mm driver**.

![IMG_0236 (1).JPG](_images/IMG_0236_(1).JPG)

## Step 4: Add on the Z-Axis V-Wheels
Add a **V-wheel** with an **eccentric 6mm spacer** to the hole nearest the middle of the **cross-slide plate**. The V-wheel should be on the same side of the plate as the other components and secured with a **washer** and an **M5 locknut** on the other side.

![IMG_0237 (1).JPG](_images/IMG_0237_(1).JPG)



![IMG_0267.JPG](_images/IMG_0267.JPG)



![IMG_0268.JPG](_images/IMG_0268.JPG)

Using **M5x30mm screws**, attach two **V-wheels** with **normal 6mm spacers** to the corner holes of the **cross-slide plate**. The V-wheels should be on the same side of the plate as the motor and the delrin leadscrew block. Secure these wheels with a **washer** and an **M5 locknut** on the other side of the plate.

![IMG_0269.JPG](_images/IMG_0269.JPG)



![IMG_0270.JPG](_images/IMG_0270.JPG)

## Step 5: Add the Gantry V-Wheels
Flip the cross-slide over so that all of the components you have added so far are facing away from you.

Add a **V-wheel** with an **eccentric 6mm spacer** to the hole in the middle of the bottom edge of the **cross-slide plate**, nearest the **delrin leadscrew block**

![IMG_0271.JPG](_images/IMG_0271.JPG)

Using **M5x30mm screws**, **M5 washers**, and **M5 locknuts**, attach two **V-wheels** with **normal 6mm spacers** to the holes in the middle of the left and right edges of the **cross-slide plate**.

![IMG_0274.JPG](_images/IMG_0274.JPG)

_Note: this picture does not show the other components attached yet. The other components should be facing away from you._

.

## Step 6: Add the Cable Carrier Mounting Bracket
Use two **M5x16mm screws** and **M5 locknuts** to secure the 3D printed **cable carrier mounting bracket** to the **cross-slide plate**. The bracket should be on the opposite side of the plate as the motor. The bracket should be oriented such that the bracket part is below the mounting screws.

# Troubleshooting and Maintenance



{%
include callout.html
type="info"
title="Don't forget about general maintenace"
content="The tips below apply specifically to the cross-slide and no other components of your FarmBot. Make sure to view the [General Maintenance](../FarmBot-Genesis-V0.9-Docs/maintenance-guide.md) page as well for system-wide tips."
%}

## Inspect the delrin leadscrew block
Over time, it is possible for the delrin leadscrew block to wear down. This can introduce play into the system that decreases z-axis precision, which can cause issues with the mounting and dismounting of tools.

{%
include callout.html
type="success"
title="Once per year"
content="Inspect the delrin ledscrew block for signs of wear. You can do this by gently pushing and pulling up and down on the leadscrew to see if you can feel any looseness in the system. If you detect there to be a large amount of play, replace the leadscrew block as soon as possible."

# Change Log

* Cross-slide plate is larger and has more V-wheels to accommodate the larger gantry main beam and provide a more rigid connection with the Z-axis extrusion and the gantry main beam

# Room for Improvement

* It can be difficult to fit the rotary encoder and motor cables and connectors through the slot in the plate. This slot will be enlarged.
* The long cable carrier mount should have a gusset to prevent drooping in the hot sun. The orientation should be flipped so that a gusset can be placed underneath just like the short cable carrier and driveshaft mounts and supports.
* The gantry main plate holes for eccentric spacers are slightly too small. This means that a hammer is required to fit the eccentric spacer into the hole. Increasing the diameter of the hole slightly will allow the spacers to fit in without tools.
