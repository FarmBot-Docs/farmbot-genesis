With V0.9 hardware we introduced our first weed suppression/removal tool. This single 3D printable component magnetically mounts onto FarmBot's UTM like any other tool. It works by driving the tool vertically into the soil in order to push any small weeds under the soil, and disrupt their young fragile root systems. When the tool is retracted out of the soil, the plastic fins grab the soil and lift it up - further disrupting the roots and soil.

title="Weeding early and often"
content="This tool, and FarmBot in general, is designed for removing weeds early and often such that the weeds are always **small, young, and fragile**, and therefore easily removed.

What makes this possible is FarmBot's diligence. FarmBot has 24 hours a day to maintain your garden meticulously. It can be configured to remove weeds every single day that a human would never waste their time with. This prevents weeds from even having a chance at becoming a real problem.

If you configure FarmBot well, you will never even notice weeds in your garden because they will never have a chance to survive beyond germination. Over time, the number of weed seeds in your growing area will approach zero."

content="Do not expect this tool, or FarmBot in general, to be able to remove large, established weeds. Instead, configure your FarmBot to weed more often so that weeds do not have a chance at becoming large and established."

# Assembly Instructions



{%

type="info"
title="15 minutes"
content="This is the estimated time it will take to assemble the Weed Suppressor."
%}

## Step 1: Gather the parts and tools
Gather all the weed suppressor parts from the table below and lay them out in a logical manner. To complete the assembly, you will also need the following tools:
* 2mm hex (allen) driver
* 3mm hex (allen) driver
* 6mm wrench
* 8mm wrench
* Wire strippers

|Qty.                          |Component                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|1                             |Weed Suppressor Base
|3                             |Ring Magnets (15 x 15 x 5mm)
|3                             |M5 x 25mm Screws
|3                             |M5 Locknuts
|2                             |M3 x 16mm Screws
|2                             |M3 Locknuts
|1                             |Jumper Wire (18 guage, 5cm length)
|2                             |Zipties

## Step 2: Install the Magnets

{%
include callout.html
type="info"
title="Opposites attract"
content="For the weed suppressor to correctly mount to the UTM, all magnets on the weed suppressor must be attracted to the magnets in the UTM.

To find the correct orientation for a weed suppressor magnet, hold it near the mounting side of the UTM. Flip it around in your hand until you feel it attracting to the UTM's magnets. This is the correct orientation for mounting to the weed suppressor base."
%}

Secure the three **ring magnets** to the top of the **weed suppressor base** using three **M5 x 25mm** screws and **M5 locknuts**. The screw head should be on the magnet side of the weed suppressor base. Use the **3mm hex driver** and **8mm wrench** to tighten the components.


## Step 3: Install the Electrical Screws
Use the **2mm hex driver** and **6mm wrench** to attach two **M3 x 16mm screws** and **M3 locknuts** into the holes labelled 2 and 3 on the **weed suppressor base**. The screw heads should be on the same side of the base as the magnets.


## Step 4: Add the Jumper Wire
Use **wire strippers** to remove 1cm of insulation from both ends of the **jumper wire**.


Attach the **jumper wire** to the **M3 screws** using two **zipties**.




# Troubleshooting and Maintenance

title="Don't forget about general maintenance"
content="The tips below apply specifically to the UTM and no other components of your FarmBot. Make sure to view the [General Maintenance](../FarmBot-Genesis-V0.9-Docs/maintenance-guide.md) page as well for system-wide tips."

## Remove Magnetic Debris Buildup
It is possible for dust, soil, and other debris to magnetically attract to the weed suppressor's magnets and build up over time. This debris can prevent the weed suppressor from correctly mounting to the UTM.

# Change Log

This was the first weed suppressor design

# Room for Improvement

* Create multiple versions of the weed suppressor that are optimized for different soil types
