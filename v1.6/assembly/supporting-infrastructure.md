FarmBot's tracks need to be attached to **supporting infrastructure** such as a typical raised garden bed. Where you decide to install your FarmBot will determine how you setup your tracks and therefore what type of supporting infrastructure you need.

In the next sections we offer advice for building three types of supporting infrastructure: a **fixed raised bed**, a **mobile raised bed**, and **pier block supports**. However, not every type of infrastructure is suitable for all of our kits. Refer to the table below to see our recommendations.
