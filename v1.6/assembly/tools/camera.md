The camera is not a typical FarmBot tool in the sense that it does not mount onto the universal tool mount and it is not stored in a toolbay. Instead, it remains fixed in place on the z-axis next to the UTM and can be used at any time, even when other tools are mounted.

The camera itself is a borescope style camera that is fully waterproof. It can be used to take photos for weed detection, phenotyping research, or [time lapse photography](../../extras/mods/take-time-lapse-plant-photography.md) of your plants growing.

# Step 1: Attach the camera to the z-axis

Sandwich the [[camera]] between the two [[camera mount halves]]. Then attach the **camera and mounts** to the **z-axis** using the two [[M5 x 10mm screws]] and a [[40mm nut bar]].
