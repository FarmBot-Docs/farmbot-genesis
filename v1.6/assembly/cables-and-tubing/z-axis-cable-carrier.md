# Step 1: Prepare the cable carrier

Remove all of the snap-in **tabs** from the **z-axis cable carrier**. The z-axis cable carrier is the shortest cable carrier in the kit.

# Step 2: Orient the cable carrier

There is only one orientation that the **z-axis cable carrier** mounts to the **cross-slide** and **z-axis**, and it is determined by the orientation of the **end pieces**. Inspect the images below to see how the cable carrier will be mounted, but do not attach it at this time.

" %}

# Step 3: Lay everything into the cable carrier

Keeping the mounting orientation of the cable carrier in mind, lay the **UTM cable**, the **z-axis water tube (0.95m)**, the **vacuum pump cable (z-axis section)**, the **camera**, the **z-axis motor cable (z-axis section)**, and the **z-axis encoder cable (z-axis section)** into the open cable carrier. The ends of all cabling and tubing should be offset from the **z-axis end** of the cable carrier as follows:

|Cable/Tube|Extension<br>(beyond the Z end)|
|----------|-------------------------------|
|[Z-axis water tube](../../extras/bom/tubing.md#water-tube)<br>_0.95m long_|10cm
|[UTM cable](../../extras/bom/electronics-and-wiring/utm.md#utm-cable)<br>_End with the yellow and black connectors_|10cm
|[Camera](../../extras/bom/electronics-and-wiring/camera.md#camera)|15cm
|[Vacuum pump cable (z-axis section)](../../extras/bom/electronics-and-wiring/vacuum-pump.md#vacuum-pump-cable)<br>_End with the quick-connect terminals_|30cm
|[Z-axis motor cable (z-axis section)](../../extras/bom/electronics-and-wiring/motors.md#motor-cables)<br>_End with the white motor plug_|100cm
|[Z-axis encoder cable (z-axis section)](../../extras/bom/electronics-and-wiring/motors.md#encoder-cables)<br>_End with the white encoder plug_|100cm

# Step 4: Snap in some tabs

Snap in three **cable carrier tabs** at both ends of the cable carrier, and a handful more spread throughout the middle so that as you mount the assembly, the cables and tubing will stay in place. Do not snap in all of the tabs at this time because that will make it difficult to make adjustments if needed.

# Step 5: Mount the cable carrier

Carefully drape the cable carrier assembly into position. Attach the cross-slide end of the **cable carrier** to the **cross-slide** using two **M5 x 30mm screws**, **M5 flange locknuts**, and the **60mm cable carrier spacer block**. The screws should thread firmly through the cable carrier end piece.

![Mount the cable carrier to the cross-slide](_images/mount_z_cc_to_cross_slide.png)
" %}

Now attach the z-axis end of the **cable carrier** to the lowest **vertical cable carrier support** on the **z-axis** using two **M5 x 16mm screws** and **M5 flange locknuts**. The screws should thread firmly through the cable carrier end piece.

# Step 6: Connect the z-axis motor and encoder

Feed the **z-axis motor and encoder cables** up through the slots in the **vertical cable carrier supports**, and then through the slot in the **z-axis motor mount**. Then connect the cables to the motor and encoder.

# Step 7: Add the vertical motor housing

Attach the **80mm vertical motor housing** to the **z-axis extrusion** using **M5 x 10mm screws** and **tee nuts**.

# Step 8: Snap in the remaining tabs

Once everything is situated well, snap-in the remaining **cable carrier tabs**, ensuring that you maintain organization of the cables and tube.
