# Organize your parts

When you first open up your FarmBot hardware package, pull out all of the component bags and boxes so that you develop a full idea of what's included, and so that you can place them on a table in locations that make sense to you. For the most part, components are already organized inside the boxes, but it is still good to take a look over everything.
