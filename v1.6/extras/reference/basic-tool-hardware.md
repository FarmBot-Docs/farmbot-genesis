# Step 1: Install the magnets

{%

type="danger"
title="Handle magnets with care"
content="In general, magnets are brittle and can be easily broken if dropped or if they attract to each other in an uncontrolled manner and collide. **When handling the magnets, DO NOT separate them individually and place them on a table.** It is too easy for two of them to attract to each other, collide, and break. Instead, keep them in a stack and pull them off individually as you mount them to the UTM and various tools."
%}

{%
include callout.html
type="info"
title="Opposites attract"
content="For tools to correctly mount to the UTM, all magnets on the tool must be attracted to the magnets in the UTM.

To find the correct orientation for a tool magnet, hold it near the mounting side of the UTM. Flip it around in your hand until you feel it attracting to the UTM's magnets. This is the correct orientation for mounting to the top of a tool."
%}

Secure the three **ring magnets** to the top of the **tool** using three [[M5 x 16mm screws]] and [[M5 flange locknuts]]. Use the 3mm hex driver and 8mm wrench to tighten the components. *Note: the watering nozzle will require [[M5 x 30mm screws]]*.

# Step 2: Install the tool verification jumper link

Insert two [[M3 x 12mm screws]] into the holes labelled **B** and **C** on the top of the **tool**.
