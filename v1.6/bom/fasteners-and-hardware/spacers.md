# M5 x 6mm Spacers

These spacers are used to offset V-wheels from plates so that they may engage extrusions.

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Length       |Measure the spacing that the spacer will provide using calipers.|6mm|+/- 0.2mm
|OD           |Measure the outer diameter using calipers.|10mm|+/- 0.2mm
|ID           |Measure the inner diameter using calipers.|5.1mm|+/- 0.1mm
|Material     |Ensure the material is aluminum or stainless steel and will not rust by holding a magnet to the part.|Aluminum or stainless steel (no magnetic attraction)|Weak attraction to stainless steel is permissible.

# M5 x 6mm Eccentric Spacers

When rotated, eccentric spacers accurately position V-wheels on a plate such that they can firmly engage V-slot aluminum extrusions. They are only used on wheels on one side of an extrusion. Adjustments are made by using a 8mm wrench on the spacer itself.
