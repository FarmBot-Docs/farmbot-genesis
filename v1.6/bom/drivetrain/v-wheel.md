|Test          |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Outer diameter|Measure the outer diameter of the v-wheel with digital calipers.|23.89mm|+/- 0.1mm
|Inner diameter|Measure the inner diameter of the v-wheel (where the bearings will sit) with digital calipers.|15.974mm|+/- 0.05mm
|Bearing material|Ensure the material is stainless steel and will not rust by holding a magnet to the bearing.|Stainless steel (no magnetic attraction)|Weak attraction to stainless steel is permissible.
|Bearing trade size|Inspect the bearing's trade size|`S625RS` or `SS-625-2RS`|N/A
|Bearing fit   |Assemble a V-wheel, two bearings, and an M5 precision shim.|Assembly should fit together snug without play.|N/A
|Width         |Measure the width of the v-wheel with digital calipers.|10.23mm|+/- 0.1mm
|V-angle       |Using a digital protractor, measure the angle that the two V-sides of the wheel create.|90 degrees|+/- 2 degrees
|Extrusion fit |Roll a V-wheel along an extrusion.|The wheel should fit properly in the V-slot of the extrusion.|N/A
|Smoothness    |Inspect the wheel to ensure there are no eroneous grooves, cuts, or knicks|No blemishes|N/A
