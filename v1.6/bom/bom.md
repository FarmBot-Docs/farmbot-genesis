title="A note on pricing"
content="The prices listed are for informational purposes for DIY builders interested in sourcing and manufacturing all of the FarmBot parts themselves.

The prices do not take into account shipping fees, taxes, import duties, minimum order quantities, waste, or the countless hours you will need to spend researching. If you are sourcing parts yourself, you might expect to pay about 20% more for the components than these tables indicate to account for all these factors. Meanwhile, you may be able to save some money if you are capable of manufacturing parts yourself (3D printing, machining, etc).

At this time we do not provide support for DIY builders beyond what is written in this open-source documentation as-is. If you need help building your own FarmBot from scratch, consider participating in the [community forum](https://forum.farmbot.org)."
