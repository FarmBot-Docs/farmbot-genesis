# Component tests

## Size and shape

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Length       |Measure the length of each extrusion with a measuring tape.|See spec in BOM listing|+/- 2mm
|Profile      |Measure the outer width and outer height of each extrusion profile using calipers.|See spec in BOM listing|+/- 0.25mm
|Straightness |Place the extrusion on a reference table with a flatness tolerance of 0.5mm per 1m or better.|0mm deviation|+ 3mm
|Square ends  |Measure the angle of the cut ends relative to the four major faces of the extrusion using a digital angle finder.|90 deg|+/- 0.5 deg
|Deburred     |Inspect cut ends and all edges to ensure there are no burrs|0 burrs|+ 1 minor<br>+ 0 major

## Material and appearance

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Material     |Ensure the material is aluminum and will not rust by holding a magnet to the extrusion.|Aluminum (no magnetic attraction)|N/A
|Sandblasting |Inspect for thorough sandblasting coverage.|100%|- 1%
|Annodization |Inspect for thorough annodization coverage.|100%|- 1%

## Function

|Test           |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Drop-In Tee Nut|Assemble a drop-in tee nut, M5 screw, and horizontal cable carrier support. Fasten the parts straight to an extrusion face and slot (without sliding the tee nut in from the end of the extrusion).|The parts should fasten securely to the extrusion.|N/A
|Nut Bar        |Assemble a nut bar, M5 screw, and horizontal cable carrier support. Slide the parts into the slot from the end of the extrusion and tighten.|The parts should fasten securely to the extrusion.|N/A
|V-Wheel        |Slide an assembled gantry wheel plate and an assembled cross-slide onto an extrusion and adjust the eccentric spacers.|The subassemblies should glide smoothly along the full length of the extrusion.|N/A
