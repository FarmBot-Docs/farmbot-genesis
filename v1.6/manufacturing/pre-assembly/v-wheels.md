Each V-Wheel consists of four components:
* One [V-wheel](../../extras/bom/drivetrain.md#v-wheel)
* Two [bearings](../../extras/bom/drivetrain.md#v-wheel)
* One [M5 shim](../../extras/bom/drivetrain.md#v-wheel)

# Step 1: Insert the first bearing

Press one **bearing** into the **v-wheel**.

content="If all goes well, you should here a satisfying 'pop' each time a bearing fits into the wheel."

# Step 2: Insert the precision shim

Insert the **precision shim** such that it is resting on the first bearing on the inside of the wheel. Try to position the shim in the center of the wheel.

# Step 3: Insert the second bearing

 Press the second **bearing** into the **v-wheel**.

title="Shimmy the shim"
content="If the second bearing doesn't seem to fit all the way into the wheel, its probably because the shim is misaligned. Use a small screwdriver to push the shim into the center of the wheel, and then push the bearing in the rest of the way."
