Each component in the tubing category has its own unique tests.

# Tubes

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|

|Length       |Measure the length with a tape measure.|See BOM spec.|+/- 10mm
|Flexibility  |Inspect for flexibility.|Tubing should be very flexible|N/A
|Kink resistance|Bend the tube into a 10cm diameter circle.|The tube should not kink|N/A
|Barb compatibility|Connect to a barbed adapter.|The tube should connect securely and resist being disconnected by hand.|N/A

# Barb

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Threads      |Connect to an M5 brass insert on top of the UTM.|Parts should connect as expected|N/A
|Hex size     |Use an 8mm wrench to tighten the barb on top of the UTM.|The hex size should work with an 8mm wrench|N/A
|Barb         |Connect a 6mm ID tube.|The tube should connect securely and have mildly resist being disconnected by hand.|N/A

# Inline Air Filter

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Barb size    |Connect a 6mm ID tube to both ends of the air filter.|Tube should fit snugly onto the barbs and not fall off.|N/A
|Airflow      |Connect the filter inline to a vacuum pump and UTM. Turn on the pump and mount a seed injector tool to the UTM.|The vacuum should provide enough suction even with the inline filter installed to pick up seeds.|N/A# Inline Air Filter

# 90 Degree Barb

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Barb size    |Connect a 6mm ID tube to both ends.|Tube should fit snugly onto the barbs and not fall off.|N/A
|Water flow   |Connect the barb inline to a water line and turn on the water.|The water should flow sufficiently without issue.|N/A

# NPT to Barb Adapter

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Threads      |Connect the adapter to a solenoid valve.|Parts should connect as expected|N/A
|Barb         |Connect a 6mm ID tube to the barbed end.|The tube should connect securely and resist being disconnected by hand.|N/A
|Engraving    |Inspect the part for an engraved label.|Should say `NPT`|N/A

# Garden Hose to Barb Adapter

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Threads      |Connect the adapter to a garden hose.|Parts should connect as expected|N/A
|Barb         |Connect a tube to the barbed end.|The tube should connect securely and resist being disconnected by hand.|N/A
|Engraving    |Inspect the part for an engraved label.|Should say `GHT`|N/A

# O-rings

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |

|Thickness    |Measure the thickness with digital calipers.|1.5mm|+/-0.1mm
|Color        |Inspect the part's color|Black|N/A
|UTM fit      |Slide an o-ring onto a UTM liquid/gas port and then vigorously shake the UTM up and down.|The o-ring should stay in place.|N/A

# Pressure Regulator

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|

|Luer lock    |Connect a needle to a luer lock adapter.|Should connect securely with a 1/4 turn|N/A
|Material     |Ensure the needle is stainless steel and will not rust by holding a magnet to the part.|Stainless steel (no magnetic attraction)|Weak attraction to stainless steel is permissible.

# Luer Lock Needles

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Outer diameter|Measure the outer diameter using digital calipers.|1.65mm (16 guage)<br>1.07mm (19 guage)<br>0.71mm (22 guage)|+/- .05mm
