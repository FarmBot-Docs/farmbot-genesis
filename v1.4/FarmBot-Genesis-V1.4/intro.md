content="As of August 10, 2018, the default version of the documentation is v1.4. If you have a v1.2 or v1.3 kit, please use the older documentation by using the version picker dropdown menu in the top left of the documentation hub's navigation. If you are putting together a new Genesis v1.4 or Genesis XL v1.4 kit, you're in the right place!"

FarmBot Genesis is designed to be a flexible FarmBot foundation for experimentation, prototyping, and hacking. The driving factors behind the design are simplicity, manufacturability, scalability, and hackability.

With the v1.4 release, we introduced a larger model named **FarmBot Genesis XL**. The dimensions of Genesis and Genesis XL can be compared below.

Genesis and Genesis XL share many of the same components and assembly steps. This documentation covers the assembly, bill of materials, troubleshooting tips, and more of both sized kits. When certain information only applies to one kit or the other, there will be clear indication.
