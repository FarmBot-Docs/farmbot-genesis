Building a mobile raised bed is the recommended method for installing a FarmBot **indoors**. In these instructions we show you how to build a simple but sturdy bed suited for FarmBot Genesis. Please note, we do not recommend building a mobile raised bed for Genesis XL devices, as that would be unwieldy and prohibitively difficult to move.

## Determining bed size
We recommend building your mobile raised bed as big as it can be for your space, without exceeding the maximum assembled size of the FarmBot. This will ensure you get the most value out of your FarmBot without making the bed unnecessarily large. See the [economies of scale](../../FarmBot-Genesis-V1.4/intro/high-level-overview.md#economies-of-scale) section for more information on maximizing FarmBot value.

title="Consider your space"
content="In determining how large your bed can be, consider if you will ever need to move the bed from room to room, down any hallways, around any corners, and/or through any doorways. Your bed should be able to fit nicely in all the places you want to place it *and* be moveable between those places."

For FarmBot Genesis kits, the outer width of your bed must not be wider than 1.48m. While the outer length _can_ be longer than 3m, we do not recommend building beyond 3m long, as any larger and the bed will become unwieldy, and that soil space will not be reachable by the FarmBot.

Refer to the table below for the recommended **maximum** outer dimensions of the bed.

|FarmBot Model                 |Outer Bed Width               |Outer Bed Length              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|Genesis                       |1.48m max                     |3m max

In the step-by-step instructions below, we'll be building a bed that is narrower than the maximum size to facilitate reaching into the center of the bed. The outer dimensions of our bed will be 1.13m wide by 3m in length. The height from the floor to the top of the bed will be approximately 0.75m.

# Step 2: Lay out the floor panels and legs
Lay the two **side floor panels** on the floor to form the outer shape of the bed. There should be about a 0.5m gap between them. The 105cm edges should be on the short sides of the bed outline.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.09.37 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.09.37_PM.png)

# Step 3: Mark where the legs will go
Stand the four **legs** up on the four corners of the **floor panels**. Using a pencil, mark where the inner edges of the legs meet the floor panels. Then remove the legs.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.12.27 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.12.27_PM.png)

# Step 4: Cut and attach the floor supports
If not already cut to length, cut the **floor supports** such that they will fit on the **floor panels** as shown, ensuring that they do not intrude on the space needed for the legs as marked in the previous step.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.25.08 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.25.08_PM.png)

Flip everything over and attach the supports to the panels using **30mm screws** spaced roughly every 150mm.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.28.30 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.28.30_PM.png)

# Step 5: Attach the short walls
Temporarily raise one **floor panel** subassembly off of the floor by 90mm by positioning **legs** underneath the **floor supports**.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.32.41 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.32.41_PM.png)

Now position one of the **short walls** against the short edge of the **floor panel** as shown.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.33.47 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.33.47_PM.png)

Attach the **short wall** to the **short floor support** using **65mm screws** spaced roughly every 150mm. Ensure you offset the screws from those used in the previous step to ensure there are no collisions. You may want to pre-drill through the short wall.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.37.03 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.37.03_PM.png)

Repeat for the second panel and second short wall.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.40.29 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.40.29_PM.png)

# Step 6: Attach the long walls
Position one of the **long walls** such that its end faces are flush with the outer faces of the **short walls**.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.44.59 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.44.59_PM.png)

Attach the **long wall** to the **long floor supports** using **65mm screws** spaced roughly every 150mm. Ensure you offset the screws from those used in the previous steps to ensure there are no collisions. You may want to pre-drill through the long wall.

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.49.28 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.49.28_PM.png)

Repeat for the second long wall.

# Step 7: Attach the legs
Using the help of another person (or two), carefully flip the raised bed upside down.

content="Remember: the **legs** are underneath the bed because you temporarily used them to offset the panels from the floor. Make sure not to trip on them when flipping the bed."

![Screen Shot 2019-03-15 at 6.57.03 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2019-03-15_at_6.57.03_PM.png)

Position one of the **legs** in the corner of the bed.

![Capture.JPG](_images/Capture.JPG)

Mark and pre-drill one hole for an **M10 bolt* all the way through the long wall and leg. Then mark and pre-drill a second hole all the way through the short wall and leg. You may want to clamp the leg in place for pre-drilling.

{%

type="warning"
title="Don't let the bolts hit each other"
content="Make sure to stagger the holes slightly so that the bolt coming in from one side of the bed does not hit the bolt coming in from the other side."
%}



![Holes.JPG](_images/Holes.JPG)

Attach the **leg** to the bed using two **M10 x 150mm bolts**, four **large M10 washers**, and two **M10 nuts**. One washer should be placed between each bolt head and the wood and between each nut and the wood.

![Screws.JPG](_images/Screws.JPG)

Repeat for the remaining three **legs**.

![Legs.JPG](_images/Legs.JPG)

# Step 8: Attach the casters
Using four **65mm screws**, attach a **caster** to the bottom of a **leg**.

![Caster.JPG](_images/Caster.JPG)

Repeat for the remaining three casters.

![Casters.JPG](_images/Casters.JPG)

# Step 9: Attach the middle floor panel
With the help of an extra person, flip the raised bed over onto its wheels. You may want to lock the casters before flipping the bed over, to prevent it from rolling.

![On Wheels.JPG](_images/On_Wheels.JPG)

Position the **middle floor panel** over the gap in the middle of the bed, and attach it to the **side floor panels** using **30mm screws** spaced roughly every 150mm.

![middle.JPG](_images/middle.JPG)

# Step 10: Apply the sealer or stain
Consider using an orbital sander to smooth out any rough edges and corners, and remove any markings on the wood. Then follow the instructions on the the can of the **stain or sealer** you purchased to give your bed a finished look. While this step is optional, it can go a long way towards improving the aesthetics of your FarmBot installation.

# Step 11: Add the bed liner
Unfold the **tarp** and lay it in the bed such that it wraps up the side walls. You can cut off the extra tarp material or simply fold it back into the bed. Some cuts may need to be made to facilitate tidy folding. Optionally, you may use a staple gun to secure the tarp in place, though the soil will also hold it in place just fine.

# Step 12: Fill the bed
Fill the bed with a mix of soil and compost, and keep out large rocks and branches. We recommend purchasing potting soil from your local nursery.
