# Step 1: Attach the gantry V-wheels

Use four **M5 x 30mm screws**, **M5 washers**, and **M5 locknuts** to attach four **V-wheels** with **normal 6mm spacers** to the **cross-slide plate**.

{%

content="Make sure you attach the V-wheels to the correct side of the cross-slide plate as shown."
%}

![cs2.JPG](_images/cs2.JPG)

_Wheels with normal spacers._

Use three **M5 x 30mm screws** to attach three **V-wheels** with **eccentric 6mm spacers** to the holes shown. The V-wheels should be secured with an **M5 washer** and an **M5 locknut** on the other side.

![cs3.JPG](_images/cs3.JPG)

_Bottom three wheels with eccentric spacers._

# Step 2: Add the Z-axis V-wheels

Flip the cross-slide over so that all of the V-wheels you have added so far are facing away from you.

![cs4.JPG](_images/cs4.JPG)

Use two **M5 x 30mm screws** to attach two **V-wheels** with **normal 6mm spacers** to the holes shown. Secure these wheels with an **M5 washer** and an **M5 locknut** on the other side of the plate.

![cs5.JPG](_images/cs5.JPG)

_Wheels with normal spacers._

Use three **M5 x 30mm screws** to attach three **V-wheels** with **eccentric 6mm spacers** to the holes shown. The V-wheels should be secured with an **M5 washer** and an **M5 locknut** on the other side.

_Right three wheels with eccentric spacers._

# Step 3: Attach the delrin leadscrew block
Insert two **M5 locknuts** into the **delrin leadscrew block's** hexagonal counterbores. With the locknuts and delrin block facing you, attach it to the side of **cross-slide plate** as shown. Secure the block using two **M5 x 16mm screws** from the opposite side of the plate.

# Step 4: Attach the stepper motor

Insert the **stepper motor** into the **horizontal motor housing** such that the motor and encoder connectors are facing down, out the open face of the housing.

![Screen Shot 2017-02-12 at 3.52.13 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2017-02-12_at_3.52.13_PM.png)

Use four **M3 x 12mm screws** to attach the **stepper motor** and **motor housing** to the **cross-slide plate**.

{%

type="warning"
title="Orientation is key"
content="The motor and housing should be on the same side of the cross-slide plate as the delrin leadscrew block and the motor and encoder connectors should be facing down towards the delrin leadscrew block."
%}



![cs8.5.JPG](_images/cs8.5.JPG)

Slide a **GT2 pulley** onto the **stepper motor** shaft. Make sure that both setscrews are lined up with the flat spots of the motor shaft. Then tighten the setscrews with the **2mm driver**.


![cs9.JPG](_images/cs9.JPG)

# Step 5: Add the long cable carrier support
Use two **M5 x 16mm screws**, **M5 washers**, and **M5 locknuts** to secure the **long cable carrier support** to the **cross-slide plate**. The bracket should be on the opposite side of the plate as the motor. The washers should be on the same side of the plate as the motor.

![cs10.JPG](_images/cs10.JPG)

# Step 6: Adjust the eccentric spacers
In order for the cross-slide to slide smoothly and wobble-free on the gantry main beam, you must first adjust the eccentric spacers of the bottom three V-wheels. Adjust the eccentric spacers using the [eccentric spacer adjustment reference guide](../Extras/reference/eccentric-spacer-adjustment.md).

# Step 7: Slide the cross-slide onto the gantry main beam
Once you have adjusted the eccentric spacers, slide the cross-slide onto the gantry main beam.

![mount cs.JPG](_images/mount_cs.JPG)

# Step 8: Feed and secure the belt
Use a **belt clip**, **M5 x 10mm screw**, and **M5 tee nut** to secure one end of the **y-axis GT2 timing belt** (2m long for Genesis, 3.5m long for XL) to the end of the gantry main beam. The belt must be wrapped through the clip as outlined in the [Belt Clip Installation](../Extras/reference/belt-clip-installation.md) reference guide.

![Screen Shot 2017-02-12 at 4.00.25 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2017-02-12_at_4.00.25_PM.png)

Feed the **belt** under the end **V-wheel** of the cross-slide, then over the **GT2 pulley** and under the remaining three **V-wheels**. The flat side of the belt should be in contact with your V-wheels while the toothed side should engage with the teeth on the pulley.

{%

%}



![ybelt.JPG](_images/ybelt.JPG)

Secure the belt at the other end of the gantry with another **belt clip**, **M5 x 10mm screw**, and **M5 tee nut**. Put a small amount of tension on the belt as you tighten the M5 screw.
