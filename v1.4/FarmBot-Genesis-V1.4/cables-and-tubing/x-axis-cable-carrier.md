# Step 1: Prepare the cable carrier

Remove all of the snap-in **tabs** from the **x-axis cable carrier**.

# Step 2: Orient the cable carrier

There is only one orientation that the **x-axis cable carrier** mounts to the **gantry** and **tracks**, and it is determined by the orientation of the **end pieces**. Lay the cable carrier onto the track's **horizontal cable carrier supports** but do not attach it at this time.




# Step 3: Lay out the tubing and wiring

If not done already, disconnect the **power supply cable** from the **power supply**.

Lay the second **water tube** and the **power supply cable** into the open **x-axis cable carrier**. The red connector of the **power supply cable** should extend beyond the gantry-mounted cable carrier end by about 50cm so that it can plug into the Farmduino. The water tube should be extended the same distance.

content="When laying the cable and tube in the carrier, ensure that they do not criss-cross over each other. If they do, you will have trouble snapping in the tabs and you risk compressing the tube and preventing water flow."

# Step 4: Snap in some tabs

Snap in three **cable carrier tabs** at both ends of the cable carrier, and ten more spread throughout the middle of the cable carrier so that as you mount the assembly, the cable and tube will stay in place. You do not want to snap in all of the tabs at this time because that will make it difficult to adjust anything if needed.

# Step 5: Mount the cable carrier to the gantry

Carefully flip over the end of the **cable carrier** such that the end piece is positioned on the **horizontal cable carrier support** on the **gantry column**. Make sure you maintain organization of the cable and tube when doing this.


Attach the **x-axis cable carrier** to the **horizontal cable carrier mount** using two **M5 x 16mm screws**, **M5 washers**, and **M5 locknuts**.

# Step 6: Mount the cable carrier to the tracks

Attach the other end of the **x-axis cable carrier** to the **horizontal cable carrier support** nearest the middle of the **tracks** using two **M5 x 16mm screws**, **M5 washers**, and **M5 locknuts**.

# Step 7: Snap in the remaining tabs

Once everything is situated well, snap-in the remaining **cable carrier tabs**, ensuring that you maintain organization of the cable and tube.
