This upgrade involves replacing the UTM, UTM cover, and UTM cable with the v1.4 injection molded UTM featuring an integrated PCB with gold-plated pogo pins, as well as a v1.4 UTM cable with unified connectors and rubber cover. This upgrade may improve the reliability of the electrical connections between the UTM and the tools. If you haven't finished building your FarmBot, the v1.4 hardware is also much easier to assemble/install than the v1.2 or v1.3 hardware.

content="The v1.4 UTM cable has a 12-pin connector that is compatible with both the v1.3 and v1.4 Farmduino electronics boards.

If you are upgrading from a v1.2 kit, you can either remove the 12-pin connector from the cable and attach other connectors for plugging into the v1.2 RAMPS board (this will require additional parts and tools) OR you may also upgrade your v1.2 electronics to a Farmduino board that accepts the 12-pin connector."
