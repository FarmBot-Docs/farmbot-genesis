title="Silver is the new black"
content="As of the v1.4 hardware release, all of our aluminum extrusions are silver. This choice was made to help minimize the temperature of the extrusions when they are exposed to direct sunlight. In addition to preventing mild burns from touching a sunbathing FarmBot, keeping the temperature cool also helps control thermal expansion and contraction of the extrusions, which can cause track misalignment issues."

# Track Extrusions

Track extrusions are the primary structural component of the tracks sub-assembly. They can be combined end-to-end in order to create longer tracks. The gantry v-wheels roll along the track extrusions, allowing FarmBot to move in the x-direction.

# Gantry Columns

The gantry columns are made from aluminum extrusions. They can be scaled to be taller or shorter to satisfy your needs. The two large spaces inside the columns are used to conceal and protect the GT2 timing belts that run along the tracks and up to the gantry pulleys.

# Gantry Main Beam

This aluminum extrusion serves as the gantry's primary structural element. The cross-slide's v-wheels move across this extrusion, allowing FarmBot to move in the y-direction. It is possible to make this extrusion longer or shorter to suit your needs.

# Z-Axis Extrusion

This aluminum extrusion allows FarmBot to accurately position the UTM and tools in the z-direction. It slides through the vertically aligned wheels on the front of the cross-slide.
