|Deburred     |Inspect all edges to ensure there are no burrs|0 burrs|+ 1 minor<br>+ 0 major

# Material and appearance

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Material     |Ensure the material is aluminum and will not rust by holding a magnet to the part.|Aluminum (no magnetic attraction)|N/A
|Sandblasting |Inspect for thorough sandblasting coverage.|100%|- 1%
|Annodization |Inspect for thorough annodization coverage.|100%|- 1%
|Engraving    |Inspect engravings for aspect ratio, sharpness, and completeness.|No stretch or skew.<br>Sharp edges.<br>100% complete.|N/A

# Function

|Test         |Description  |Target       |Tolerance    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|M3 screws    |Insert M3 screws into M3 holes to ensure fit.|Screws should be insertable without interference.|N/A
|M5 screws    |Insert M5 screws into M5 holes to ensure fit.|Screws should be insertable without interference.|N/A
|Eccentric spacers|Insert an eccentric spacer into an eccentric spacer hole to ensure fit.|Spacer should fit snug without excessive play.|Light tapping with a hammer is permissible.
|Nut bars     |Fasten nut bars of appropriate lengths between holes according to FarmBot system design.|Nut bars should be fastenable without screw/hole interference.|N/A
|Motors       |Attach motors according to the FarmBot system design.|M3 screws should fasten without screw/hole interference. Motor shaft should be centered in hole and make no contact with the plate or bracket.|N/A
