# [Genesis v1.4](http://genesis.farm.bot/docs/v1.4)
**Major changes**
  * Introduced Genesis XL covering an area 3m wide and 6m in length (400% larger than the smaller FarmBot Genesis)
  * Introduced a new version of the Farmduino featuring an STM32 co-processor dedicated to monitoring the rotary encoders, 24V operation, a new 2-pin polarized red power connector, vertically oriented USB ports, pre-installed pin jumpers to connect the UTM, improved board layout for accessing the stepper drivers and dip switches, additional circuitry to better handle motor back-current, matte-black finish, and a single blade fuse
  * Introduced a new preassembled electronics box featuring five push-buttons and four LED indicator lights, the Pi Adapter Board, board mounting bosses, and modified latches to prevent catching rain
  * Introduced a new preassembled injection molded UTM featuring a PCB with gold-plated pogo pins and pin headers for attaching to the cable with shroud (eliminating the need for a separate cover and grommets)
  * Switched to 24V peripherals and a power supply delivering 24V over a single modular screw-together cable
  * Relocated the solenoid valve to the gantry column allowing for a shorter cable and modularization of the tubing

**Kit additions**
  * Gantry joining bracket to create a 3m wide gantry (XL kits only)
  * 1-slot toolbays (XL kits only)
  * Dowel pins to improve track alignment

**Minor changes**
  * Clear anodized (instead of black anodized) extrusions to minimize temperature in the sun
  * The V-wheels now come pre-assembled
  * Switched to metric silicon tubing
  * Improvements to internal and external packaging

  * Relocated the vacuum pump to the z-axis extrusion to improve suction at the needle
  * Sourced an IP67 rated universal input waterproof power supply, eliminating the need for the sockit box;
  * Injection molded many new components including the cable carrier supports, tools, seed trays, camera mounts, and cable carrier spacer block, and and vacuum pump cover

** Kit additions**
  * Z-axis hardstops
  * White LED strip

**Minor changes**
  * Replaced the weeder spikes with new sizes of the weeder blades
