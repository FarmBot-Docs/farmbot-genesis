Interested in making your own servo powered tool or peripheral? You can easily control PWM servo motors by using the [Set Servo Angle Farmware](https://github.com/FarmBot-Labs/set-servo-angle). Simply [install the farmware](https://software.farm.bot/docs/farmware#installing-farmware) onto your FarmBot, and then use the Run Farmware command in your sequences to programmatically control servos.

You can also set the servo angle from the farmware page.
