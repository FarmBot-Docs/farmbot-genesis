## Cable Management
  * Issue: There is no way to manage cables and water tubing.
  * Proposed Solution: Integrate cable carriers or another solution.

## Universal Tool Mount
  * Issue: A few of the features are not optimized for 3D printing
  * Proposed Solution: Avoid cliff hangers with tapers and chamfers
  * Issue: Very little clearance between the screws that pass power and data
  * Proposed Solution: Decrease screw size from 5mm to 3mm screws
  * Issue: Tight fit of solenoid dead bolt in the tool mount hole, creating unnecessary tolerance requirements and friction
  * Proposed Solution: Increase size of hole in the tool mount
  * Issue: Tools are not inline with the leadscrew, creating a greater moment force on the Z-axis and Cross-Slide
  * Proposed Solution: Flip the orientation of the Universal Tool Mount so that the solenoid locker and tool are switched
  * Issue: Tool mount and tool are very tall
  * Proposed Solution: Optimize the tool and mount to be shorter

## Track Belts
  * Issue: The track belts have an interference with the screws and tee nuts of the gantry corner brackets
  * Proposed Solution: Reconfigure the gantry to accomodate

## Endstops
  * Issue: The small plates/brackets used to actuate the endstops are not necessary
  * Proposed Solution: Replace these components with just a screw and a tee nut to reduce number of custom components. Reconfigure the endstops if needed

## Cross-Slide
  * Issue: The tee shaped brackets are not necessary and add complexity to the assembly of the cross slide
  * Proposed Solution: Remove them and mount the endstops on the main cross-slide plate

## Number of Screws
  * Issue: There is an unnecessary number of screws holding the tracks together and the gantry together. This is more costly and increases assembly time significantly
  * Proposed Solution: Reduce the number of screws
