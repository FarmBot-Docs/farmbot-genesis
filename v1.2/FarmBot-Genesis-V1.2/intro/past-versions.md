# [V1.1](https://genesis.farm.bot/v1.1)
Major changes: Removed the driveshaft in favor of dual x-axis motors, redesigned cable carrier supports, experimentation with the Raspberry Pi camera, new tool bay is a single bent component, new gantry corner brackets are single bent pieces, metal belt clips and cable clips, updated cross-slide, all metal z-axis motor mount, new z-axis drag chain guides, encoders and motors now have removable cables, standoffs between the electronics and the mounting plate, switched back to using the A4988 stepper drivers, improved watering nozzle design for SLA printing, switched the entire CAD workflow from Solidworks to Onshape.

# V0.0
The very first physical FarmBot prototype was made from welded steel square stock, C-channel, angle iron, garage door wheels, and a trowel. It served primarily as a visual aid.
