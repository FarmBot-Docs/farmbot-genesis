Installing the cables and tubing through FarmBot's cable carriers can be a tedious process, though it is very rewarding once you are finished. Take your time to ensure you complete this part of the assembly correct the first time, otherwise it might become frustrating if you need to re-do anything.




# Motor and Encoder Cable Reference



|Axis                          |Cable Length                  |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|X1                            |0.75m
|X2                            |2.8m
|Y                             |2.8m
|Z                             |4.5m

_It is recommended to set out the motor and encoder cables in the table above and mark both ends of each cable with the axis using a marker or tape before proceeding._
