# Step 1: Gather the parts and tools
Gather all the UTM parts from the table below and lay them out in a logical manner. To complete the assembly, you will also need the following tools:

* [2mm hex driver](../../Extras/bom/miscellaneous.md#2mm-hex-driver)
* [3mm hex driver](../../Extras/bom/miscellaneous.md#3mm-hex-driver)
* [5.5mm box wrench](../../Extras/bom/miscellaneous.md#55mm-box-wrench)
* [8mm box wrench](../../Extras/bom/miscellaneous.md#8mm-box-wrench)

# Step 2: Install the magnets

{%
include callout.html
type="warning"
title="Handle magnets with care"
content="In general, magnets are brittle and can be easily broken if dropped or if they attract to each other in an uncontrolled manner and collide. When handling your magnets, DO NOT separate them individually and place them on a table. It is too easy for two of them to attract to each other, collide, and break. Instead, keep them in a stack and pull them off individually as you mount them to the UTM and various tools."
%}



{%
include callout.html
type="info"
title="Opposites attract"
content="For the UTM to correctly mount tools, all magnets on the UTM and all tools must have the same polar orientation. For example, all of the magnets could have the North pole/face of the magnet facing towards the ground. This way, the North pole/face of the *UTM* magnets (which face the ground) will be attracted to the South pole/face of the *tool* magnets (which face the sky).

Which side is North and which is South does not matter. The important part is that the orientation of all the magnets are the same."
%}

Insert an **M5 x 16mm screw** through one of the **ring magnets**. For the first magnet, the orientation of the magnet does not matter.

Insert the magnet and screw into the bottom of the UTM as shown.

![Screen Shot 2017-02-12 at 9.00.53 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2017-02-12_at_9.00.53_PM.png)

Use the **3mm hex driver** and the **8mm wrench** to tighten an **M5 locknut** onto the screw.

![Screen Shot 2017-02-12 at 9.02.08 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2017-02-12_at_9.02.08_PM.png)

Repeat the process above for the two remaining UTM magnets.

{%
include callout.html
type="success"
title="Before tightening the last two locknuts..."
content="Ensure that the polar orientation of all the UTM magnets are the same. You can do this by holding a fourth magnet near the UTM magnets. Without flipping the magnet in your hand, it should either be attracted to all of the UTM magnets, or repelled from all of the UTM magnets. Again, it doesn't matter which way they are installed, as long as they are all the same with respect to each other."

# Step 3: Install the barbs
Use the **8mm wrench** to screw in the three **barbs** into the top of the **UTM**. The barbs should be inserted in the holes labelled 1, 2, and 3.

![Screen Shot 2017-02-12 at 9.04.36 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2017-02-12_at_9.04.36_PM.png)

# Step 4: Install the o-rings
Slide three **o-rings** onto the **UTM** 1, 2, and 3 port cones. Each o-ring should be "seated" at the base of the port cone.

# Step 5: Install the electronic contact screws
Place a **spring** on an **M3 x 30mm screw** and then insert the screw into the **UTM**.

![Screen Shot 2017-02-12 at 9.08.37 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2017-02-12_at_9.08.37_PM.png)

Using the **2mm hex driver** and the **5.5mm wrench**, attach an **M3 locknut** onto the screw. Tighten the locknut until the spring is slightly compressed.

![Screen Shot 2017-02-12 at 9.09.35 PM.png](_images/Screen_Shot_2017-02-12_at_9.09.35_PM.png)

Repeat for all holes labelled **A** through **L**.

# Step 6: Add grommets to the UTM cover
Insert four **grommets** into the **UTM cover**, ensuring that the grommet flanges are not folded or caught under themselves.

# Step 7: Add mounting hardware
Lightly screw together four **M5 x 16mm screws** and **M5 tee nuts** into the mounting flanges of both the **UTM** and **UTM cover**.
