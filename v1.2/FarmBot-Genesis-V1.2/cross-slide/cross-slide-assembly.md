# Step 2: Add the Z-axis V-wheels

Flip the cross-slide over so that all of the V-wheels you have added so far are facing away from you.

# Step 3: Attach the delrin leadscrew block
Insert two **M5 locknuts** into the **delrin leadscrew block's** hexagonal counterbores. With the locknuts and delrin block facing you, attach it to the side of **cross-slide plate** that is facing you. Secure the block using two **M5 x 16mm screws** from the opposite side of the plate.

# Step 4: Attach the stepper motor

Insert the **stepper motor** into the **horizontal motor housing** such that the motor and encoder connectors are facing down, out the open face of the housing.

# Step 5: Add the long cable carrier support
Use two **M5 x 16mm screws**, **M5 washers**, and **M5 locknuts** to secure the **long cable carrier support** to the **cross-slide plate**. The bracket should be on the opposite side of the plate as the motor.
