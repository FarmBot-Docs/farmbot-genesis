# Step 1: Attach the plates to the columns

For this part of the assembly you will need:
* The two [gantry wheel plate assemblies](../gantry/assemble-the-gantry-wheel-plates.md) from the previous page
* The [gantry columns](../../Extras/bom/extrusions.md#gantry-columns) (20mm x 60mm x 500mm extrusions)
* [3mm hex driver](../../Extras/bom/miscellaneous.md#3mm-hex-driver)

Position the **gantry column** onto the **gantry wheel plate assembly**. The extrusion should reside on the same side of the plate as the V-wheels and the end of the extrusion should be aligned with the notch in the plate. Tighten the **M5 x 10mm screws** using a **3mm hex driver**.

Repeat the above steps for the second gantry wheel plate and aluminum extrusion.

# Step 2: Attach the gantry corner brackets

For this step you will need:
* The two gantry wheel plate/column assemblies completed in the previous step
* Two [gantry corner brackets](../../Extras/bom/plates-and-brackets.md#gantry-corner-brackets)
* 20 [M5 x 10mm screws](../../Extras/bom/fasteners-and-hardware.md#m5-screws)
* 20 [M5 tee nuts](../../Extras/bom/fasteners-and-hardware.md#m5-tee-nuts)
* [3mm hex driver](../../Extras/bom/miscellaneous.md#3mm-hex-driver)

Lightly screw together 10 **M5 x 10mm screws** and **M5 tee nuts** on the **left-side gantry corner bracket** as shown.

Position the gantry column/plate assembly onto the corner bracket. Pay special attention to the orientation of the bracket, extrusion, and wheel plate. Then tighten the **M5 x 10mm screws** with the **3mm hex driver**.

# Step 3: Repeat

Repeat the above steps for the second corner bracket and column. You should end up with two assemblies that are mirror images of each other. Inspect these images closely to ensure your corner brackets are attached to the columns in the correct orientation.

# Step 4: Slide the gantry columns onto the tracks

Slide the **gantry columns** onto the **tracks**.

# Step 5: Attach the main beam

Insert eight **M5 x 10mm screws** and **M5 tee nuts** into the front face of each of the gantry corner brackets. The tee nuts should be facing the front of FarmBot.

{%

%}

Lift up the **gantry main beam** and position it onto the front of the **gantry corner brackets**. The tee nuts should fit into the *lower two extrusion slots* of the main beam such that the top face of the main beam is 20mm above the top faces of the gantry corner brackets.

_Note that this image is from the backside of FarmBot_

Ensure that the gantry columns are vertical and then tighten the 16 **M5 x 10mm screws**. Depending on the spacing of your tracks, the gantry main beam may extend beyond the corner brackets. This is ok.
