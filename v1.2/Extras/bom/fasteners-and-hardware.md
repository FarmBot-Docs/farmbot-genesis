# M5 Screws
M5 button-head screws of various lengths are used throughout FarmBot to attach plates and 3D printed parts to extrusions, V-wheels to plates, and other components together. They are usually used in combination with M5 washers, and terminated with an M5 tee nut or locknut. The button head provides a wide bearing surface, a low-profile head, and a finished appearance. Length is measured from under the head.

# M5 x 6mm Eccentric Spacers
When rotated, eccentric spacers accurately position V-wheels on a plate such that they can firmly engage V-slot aluminum extrusions. They are only used on wheels on one side of an extrusion. Adjustments are made by using a 8mm wrench on the spacer itself.
