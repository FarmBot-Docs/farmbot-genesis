# All tools

## Remove magnetic debris
It is possible for dust, soil, and other debris to magnetically attract to tool's magnets and build up over time. This debris can prevent the tool from correctly mounting to the UTM.

# Seeder

## Remove internal debris
It is possible for dust, soil, and other debris to become stuck inside of seed injector's luer loock needles. This can cause a loss of seed suction power and prevent the seed injector from working reliably.

# Watering nozzle

## Dissolve mineral buildup
It is possible - depending on your water source - for the watering nozzle to slowly become clogged with mineral buildup and other deposits. This can prevent FarmBot from watering the correct amount for each plant and can also cause uneven spray.

title="Every 6 months"
content="Inspect the watering nozzle for any deposits or unusual spray patterns. To remove mineral buildup, soak your watering nozzle in a bowl of distilled white vinegar and hot water for a few hours. This should dissolve most things. If needed, use a toothpick, thumbtack, or paperclip to remove any debris left in the nozzle holes."
