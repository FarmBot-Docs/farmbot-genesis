# Inspect the grommets and o-rings
It is possible that intense temperature and adverse weather cycles could degrade the rubber grommets in the UTM cover and the o-rings on the bottom of the UTM.

# Remove magnetic debris
It is possible for dust, soil, and other debris to magnetically attract to the UTM's magnets and build up over time. This debris can prevent the UTM from correctly mounting tools.
