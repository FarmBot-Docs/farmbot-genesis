In this section we'll go over General Maintenance tips and techniques that can keep your device operating like the day you installed it.

# Keep FarmBot Clean

FarmBot is a farmer that works and lives all day and night outside with the rain, sun, bugs, birds, and dirt. At the same time, FarmBot is a precision CNC machine with a lot of parts that allow it to move with millimeter accuracy to grow you food. Most would say these things can't co-exist. But they can with regular cleaning of your device.

content="Once a month, use a brush, sponge, broom, and a little water to clean off your FarmBot. Remove built up bird poop, mud, spider webs, and other debris. Clean out the hard to reach places, cut its nails, and treat it to a massage. Your FarmBot will appreciate your loving care and pay you back with years of vegetables."

# Tighten Loose Screws

Once a month, you should inspect your hardware for loose screws. You can do this by grabbing a component such as an extrusion and attempting to wiggle it with a small amount of force. If you can feel or hear anything rattling, a screw somewhere needs to be tightened. Use the appropriate wrench to tighten any screws that you find to be loose.

content="Under normal operating circumstance, your screws can become loose from vibrations, thermal expansion and contraction, rain, and even high winds. If a particular screw becomes loose multiple times in a short period of time, you can try putting a small amount of blue loctite onto the threads to prevent future loosening."

# Keep Eccentric Spacers Properly Adjusted

Your eccentric spacers are used for making fine adjustments to the spacing between the wheels of your moving parts (Gantry, Cross-Slide, and Z-Axis). The spacing is key to having your parts move smoothly and wobble-free.

Over time, it is possible for your wheels to wear down slightly which can cause wobbling and a loss of precision in your device. It is also possible for your wheels to 'settle' and fall out of their optimal positioning, which can also cause wobbling.

Once every three months, check your eccentric spacers for proper alignment, and make adjustments as necessary.

## Adjusting the eccentric spacer
1. Grab a 10mm wrench and slide it onto the eccentric spacer. Turn the spacer about 1/32 of a turn. Depending on the direction you turn the spacer, and the current orientation of the spacer, your spacing will either increase or decrease. Your goal is to adjust the spacer in the direction you need, so do some experimentation to find out which direction to turn it.
2. Once you have adjusted the spacer 1/32 of a turn,inspect for fit.
3. Continue the steps above until your components move smoothly and wobble.

content="The perfect fit is subjective and you'll need to play around to get it just right. Here is our best tip: Adjust your wheel spacing so that it is as large as possible without inducing wobbling or rattling. This will ensure you are not over tightening your wheels and risking damage.

You would rather have a wobbly wheel that you can tighten than damaged components.

Don't expect your components to roll like a ball down a hill. A well fitted system will have a little bit of friction. Again, just play around with the spacing and use your best judgement."

# Inspect for Damage

Once a month, inspect your hardware for visible damage such as corrosion, bending, or cracking of components. Under normal circumstances your hardware will be just fine because it is designed to withstand normal operating forces and built with corrosion and UV resistant materials.

However, certain conditions and accidents can cause damage such as:
* An unusually corrosive environment such as that near an ocean
* High temperature differences between the day and night can cause cracking
* Accidental impacts with the hardware that causes bending (tripping, falling branches, etc)

If you notice any damaged parts, promptly replace the components. If the component is not replaced, you risk damaging other components out of negligence.
