## Change Log
  * Endstops have been removed and their functionality will be replaced by a rotary encoder
  * The corner brackets have been modified to be identical to the track plates so that the gantry can scale in the same fashion as the tracks
  * Added 3D printed cable carrier and driveshaft supports to the backside of the gantry main beam
