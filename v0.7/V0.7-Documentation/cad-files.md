All of the plates can be CNC routed, laser cut, or waterjet cut. The motor housings, Universal Tool Mount, and Tools can be 3D printed. .STL and .DXF files for manufacturing can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/a/roryaronson.com/folderview?id=0B-wExYzQcnp3fkZqd0x3TUo1N2didWtvYTlSRTBocVlCVG9fYWlmcVJWUDFNbkVmdWVuTXc&usp=drive_web&tid=0B-wExYzQcnp3bmY4STBfSmJMQWc).

FarmBot Genesis V0.7 was designed natively in SolidWorks 2014. Using SolidWorks 2014 or a newer version will provide the most seamless experience if you are interested in viewing or modifying the 3D part files. All CAD files can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-wExYzQcnp3fkZqd0x3TUo1N2didWtvYTlSRTBocVlCVG9fYWlmcVJWUDFNbkVmdWVuTXc).
