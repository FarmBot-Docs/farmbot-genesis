title: "Eccentric Spacer"
slug: "eccentric-spacer"
description: "When rotated, eccentric spacers accurately position V-wheels on a plate such that they can firmly engage V-slot aluminum extrusions. They are only used on wheels on one side of an extrusion. Adjustments are made by using a 8mm wrench on the spacer itself."

|Engraving    |Inspect the part for a `6mm` engraving on the side with the shortest distance to the bore.|Engraving is in correct location|N/A
|Length       |Measure the spacing that the spacer will provide using calipers.|6mm|+/- 0.2mm
|OD           |Measure the outer diameter using calipers.|7.1mm|+/- 0.05mm
|ID           |Measure the inner diameter using calipers.|5.1mm|+/- 0.1mm
|Material     |Ensure the material is aluminum or stainless steel and will not rust by holding a magnet to the part.|Aluminum or stainless steel (no magnetic attraction)|Weak attraction to stainless steel is permissible.
