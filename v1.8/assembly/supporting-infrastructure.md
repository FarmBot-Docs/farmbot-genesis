FarmBot's tracks need to be attached to **supporting infrastructure** such as a typical raised garden bed. Where you decide to install your FarmBot will determine how you setup your tracks and therefore what type of supporting infrastructure you need.

content="If you recently ordered a FarmBot kit, you may want to begin building your supporting infrastructure while your FarmBot is in the mail. This way you'll be prepared for a faster assembly time when your package arrives."

In the next sections we offer reference designs for building four types of supporting infrastructure: a **fixed raised bed**, a **mobile raised bed**, **wood posts**, and **pier block supports**. However, not every type of infrastructure is suitable for all of our kits. Refer to the table below to see our recommendations.

# Maximum size

We recommend building your supporting infrastructure as large as possible to get the most value out of your FarmBot. See the [economies of scale](intro/high-level-overview.md#economies-of-scale) section for more information on maximizing FarmBot value.

If you are going to modify on of our reference designs, or build supporting infrastructure of your own design, use the dimension guidelines below to ensure compatibility with your FarmBot.

|FarmBot      |Outer Infrastructure Width|Outer Infrastructure Length|
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
|Genesis      |1.36m (53.5") max         |3m (118") recommended
|Genesis (XL) |2.86m (112.5") max        |6m (236") recommended

{%
include callout.html
type="warning"
title="Do not exceed the max width"
content="While you can adjust a FarmBot to accommodate smaller width infrastructure, you cannot adjust it for infrastructure larger than the maximum width listed."
%}

{%
include callout.html
type="success"
title="Longer length infrastructure is OK"
content="While FarmBot Genesis and Genesis (XL) kits only include enough track extrusions and other hardware to allow for gantry travel up to 3m and 6m respectively, creating infrastructure with a longer length will not prevent the system from being installed."
%}

# Scaling down

If your space or supporting infrastructure do not allow for the FarmBot to be built to the maximum size, you can easily scale down your installation.

|<i></i>   |Easy Method |Harder Method |
|----------|------------|--------------|
|Length    |Use fewer [[track extrusions]] to scale down in increments of 1m.|Cut the track extrusions to size using a chop saw or hack saw.|
|Width     |Use fewer [[gantry main beam]] extrusions and [[extruded 40mm horizontal cable carrier supports]] to scale down in increments of 0.75m (Genesis) or 1m (Genesis (XL)).|Cut the gantry main beam extrusions and horizontal cable carrier supports to size using a chop saw or hack saw.|
|Height    |Adjust the location of the [[Z-axis hardstops]] to limit the machine from moving too high.|Cut the [[gantry columns]] and [[Z-axis extrusion]] to length using a chop saw or hack saw.|

If scaling the machine down significantly, you may also need to:

- Coil up and zip tie excess cable length out of the way.
- Trim excess tubing and belt length with scissors.
- Remove extra cable carrier links using a small flathead screwdriver.
