When you first open up your FarmBot kit, pull out all of the pre-assemblies, individual components, and part bags so that you develop a full idea of what's included. Place everything on a table or work surface that will prevent the loss of any small parts. Ensure there are no parts remaining in the packaging before recycling.

# Plan accordingly

Be prepared to spend the following amount of time assembling your FarmBot. Remember, these are just assembly time estimations. Depending on your skill level you may need more or less time. Consider assembling FarmBot with a friend to significantly speed things up and help reduce mistakes.

|Subassembly          |Genesis       |Genesis (XL) |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------|
|Tracks               |30 minutes    |1 hour
|Gantry               |30 minutes    |1 hour
|Cross-Slide + Z-Axis |30 minutes    |30 minutes
|Cables and Tubing    |30 minutes    |30 minutes
|Electronics Box      |30 minutes    |30 minutes
|**TOTAL**            |**2.5 hours** |**3.5 hours**

# Open up the full assembly video

We've prepared a [full assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtPPEkz4fn4) that walks you through the entire process of assembling your FarmBot. We recommend keeping the video open in one tab and following along with the written instructions in another tab.

{%
include callout.html
type="warning"
content="The video below is for Genesis v1.7 machines. While we are still working on a v1.8 video, the v1.7 assembly process is largely the same and can still be generally followed with the video. However, please refer to the written documentation when encountering discrepancies, and take note of the following key changes to the v1.8 machines:
- v1.8 machines are shipped entirely in one box
- [[Track extrusions]] are 1m in length and there are more of them included
- The [[horizontal cable carrier supports]] slide into the gantry main beam rather than bolt on
- The [[vacuum pump]] must be mounted to the [[cross-slide plate]]
- Some parts will have a different appearance than those included in the v1.7 kits"
