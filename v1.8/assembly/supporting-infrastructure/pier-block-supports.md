As an alternative to [building a full raised bed](raised-bed.md), you may consider mounting your FarmBot to **pier block supports** topped with wood beams.

# Step 1: Determine bed size

We recommend building your supporting infrastructure as large as possible to get the most value out of your FarmBot, while making sure you do not exceed the [maximum size limit](../supporting-infrastructure.md#maximum-size). This will ensure you get the most value out of your FarmBot without building unnecessarily large, which can add cost.

The reference designs shown on this documentation page are for a **maximally sized** pier block infrastructure for the stock Genesis and Genesis (XL) kits. The outer dimensions (where the tracks will be mounted) will be 1.36m wide by 3m in length for Genesis, and 2.86m wide by 6m in length for Genesis (XL), with the cable carrier support adding an additional 0.04m to the total width.

If you are designing for a smaller installation, you will need to modify the dimensions of the lumber and pier layouts.

# Step 3: Position the piers

Position the piers according to a diagram below for a maximally sized growing area for FarmBot Genesis or Genesis (XL). It is recommended to bury the piers in place such that the top of the pier is about 50mm above the ground. If the piers are not buried, FarmBot may not be able to reach the soil surface with its tools, and you may need to add additional soil into the bed area.

title="Parallel or bust"
content="It is critical that the distance between the two tracks is consistent. If it is not, there will be harmful forces placed on the gantry and tracks as the gantry moves across the non-parallel tracks."
%}

# Step 4: Attach the track supports

Attach the **track supports** to the brackets using **25mm wood screws**.

![attach track support for FarmBot Genesis XL](_images/pier_blocks_attach_track_supports_genesis_xl.png)
" %}

# Step 5: Attach the toolbay support

Position the **toolbay support** 90mm from the end of the **track supports** on the side of the bed where FarmBot's home position will be. Pre-drill and counterbore the track supports for the **M10 washers and lag screws**. Then attach the toolbay support to the track supports using the **M10 washers and lag screws**.

![toolbay support for FarmBot Genesis XL](_images/pier_blocks_toolbay_support_genesis_xl.png)
" %}

# Step 6: Attach the cable carrier supports

Attach the upper **cable carrier support(s)** to the **track support** using **T25 x 75mm wood screws** or equivalent. The cable carrier support should be positioned on the track where you plan to have your FarmBot's electronics box (the left track when looking at the front of the FarmBot). The top of the support should be positioned 60mm from the top of the track.

![install cable carrier support for genesis xl](_images/pier_blocks_install_cable_carrier_support_xl.png)
" %}

Attach the lower **cable carrier support(s)** to the **track support** using **T25 x 75mm wood screws** or equivalent. The top surface should be positioned 20mm or more below the bottom surface of the first cable carrier support.

" %}

# Step 7: Seal the wood (optional)

Apply a sealer, stain, or polyurethane to the wood to protect it from the elements.
