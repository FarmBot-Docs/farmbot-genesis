_Wheels with normal spacers._

Use three **M5 x 30mm screws** to attach three **V-wheels** with **eccentric 6mm spacers** to the holes shown. The V-wheels should be secured with an **M5 washer** and an **M5 locknut** on the other side.

# Step 3: Attach the delrin leadscrew block
Insert two **M5 locknuts** into the **delrin leadscrew block's** hexagonal counterbores. With the locknuts and delrin block facing you, attach it to the side of **cross-slide plate** as shown. Secure the block using two **M5 x 16mm screws** from the opposite side of the plate.
