All of the male pipe threads in FarmBot need to be sealed with teflon tape (also known as PTFE tape and plumber's tape). The locations where this tape needs to be applied include:
* Both ends of the solenoid valve
* The outlet of the pressure regulator
* The inlet of the barbed adapter

With the component positioned with the start of the threads facing you, wrap the teflon tape clockwise around the threads. Wrapping the tape clockwise will ensure that when you screw the component into another, the tape will not unravel as you tighten.


Pull the tape tightly as you wrap it around the threads. It should be wrapped between 5 and 10 times. Cut the tape with scissors when you have finished wrapping.
