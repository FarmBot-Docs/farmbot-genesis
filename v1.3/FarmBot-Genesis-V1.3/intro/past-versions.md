# [V1.2](https://genesis.farm.bot/docs/v1.2)
Major changes: New surface treatments on all metal plates, tighter M5 hole tolerances all-around, improved UTM, machined aluminum/plastic components (instead of 3D printing or bent metal), improved cable carrier supports, added CC spacer block, machined z-axis motor mount (instead of bent/welded metal), black anodized toolbays with laser engraved FarmBot logo, back to using a borescope camera with custom 1m focal distance, developed a 2-piece watering nozzle, developed the luer-lock needle style seed injector, made the weeder customizable with various implements, switched to jumper "links" instead of wires on all tools, developed packaging for complete kits. We manufactured 350 v1.2 kits and shipped them to customers in March and April of 2017.

# [V1.1](https://genesis.farm.bot/docs/v1.1)
Major changes: Removed the driveshaft in favor of dual x-axis motors, redesigned cable carrier supports, experimentation with the Raspberry Pi camera, new tool bay is a single bent component, new gantry corner brackets are single bent pieces, metal belt clips and cable clips, updated cross-slide, all metal z-axis motor mount, new z-axis drag chain guides, encoders and motors now have removable cables, standoffs between the electronics and the mounting plate, switched back to using the A4988 stepper drivers, improved watering nozzle design for SLA printing, switched the entire CAD workflow from Solidworks to Onshape.

# V0.0
The very first physical FarmBot prototype was made from welded steel square stock, C-channel, angle iron, garage door wheels, and a trowel. It served primarily as a visual aid.
