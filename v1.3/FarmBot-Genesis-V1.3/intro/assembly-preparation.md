# Organize your parts

When you first open up your FarmBot hardware package, pull out all of the component bags and boxes so that you develop a full idea of what's included, and so that you can place them on a table in locations that make sense to you. For the most part, components are already organized inside the boxes, but it is still good to take a look over everything.

# Plan accordingly

FarmBot Genesis is a complex machine with over 1,000 components in total. Be prepared to spend the following amount of time assembling your FarmBot. Remember, these are just assembly time estimations. Depending on your skill level you may need more or less time. Consider assembling FarmBot with a friend to significantly speed things up and help reduce mistakes.
