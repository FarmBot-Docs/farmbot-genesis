# Step 2: Mount the Farmduino
Use four **M2.5 x 4mm screws** to attach four **M2.5 x 6mm standoffs** to the **electronics mounting plate**. The screws should be on the backside of the plate while the standoffs should be on the front.

# Step 4: Connect the Farmduino to the Raspberry Pi
Connect the **Raspberry Pi data cable** (shown in gray) to the **Raspberry Pi's** power input and the **Farmduino's** USB power output.

![Screen Shot 2017-10-03 at 10.16.14 PM.png](Screen_Shot_2017-10-03_at_10.16.14_PM.png)

Connect the **Farmduino data cable** (shown in black) to the **Farmduino's** data input and one of the **Raspberry Pi's** USB ports. It does not matter which USB port you plug into on the Pi.

# Step 6: Mount everything in the box
Mount the **electronics mounting plate** in the **electronics box** using six **M3 x 5mm screws**. The Farmduino should be nearest the slot in the bottom of the box.

# Step 7: Attach the stepper driver heatsinks
Peel off the protective paper on the bottom of the **stepper driver heatsinks** to expose the adhesive.

![47c3c33-IMG_6779.JPG](IMG_6779.JPG)

Press the **heatsinks** onto the **black chips** on the **stepper drivers**. Make sure the edges of the heatsinks are not touching any of the soldered components on the drivers.
