title="A note on pricing"
content="The prices listed are for informational purposes for DIY builders interested in sourcing and manufacturing all of their own FarmBot parts from scratch.

The prices do not take into account shipping fees, taxes, import duties, minimum order quantities, or waste. If you are a DIY builder, expect to pay about 20% more for the components than these tables indicate to account for all these factors. Also keep in mind that you will need to spend countless hours shopping online trying to find compatible parts and your bot will not be guaranteed to work.

At this time we do not provide support for DIY builders beyond what is written in this open-source documentation as-is. If you need help building your own FarmBot from scratch, consider participating in the [community forum](https://forum.farmbot.org)."
